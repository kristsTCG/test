# Folder Documentation

## Overview
This folder contains a single Python file named `test_code.py`. The purpose of this folder in the project is to house a script for testing specific functionalities or components of the software.

## Structure
The folder structure is simple with only one Python file present. The file `test_code.py` is responsible for executing test cases and verifying the expected behavior of certain parts of the software.

## Key Files
- `test_code.py`: This file is the main script for running test cases. It contains functions to set up test environments, execute tests, and assert expected outcomes.

## Usage
1. Open the `test_code.py` file in a Python IDE or text editor.
2. Review the existing test cases and add new ones as needed.
3. Run the script to execute the test cases and check the output for any failures.
4. Modify the test cases or the code being tested based on the results to ensure proper functionality.

Remember to adhere to best practices for writing test cases and maintain the integrity of the testing process.
