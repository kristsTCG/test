## Key Files
- `test_code.py`: This file is the main component of the folder and is crucial for testing the software. It likely includes test cases, assertions, and other testing-related code to ensure the software functions as expected.

## Usage
1. Open the `test_code.py` file in a Python IDE or text editor.
2. Review the code to understand the test cases and assertions being made.
3. Run the file using a Python interpreter to execute the tests and check for any failures or errors.
4. Analyze the test results to ensure the software functions correctly and troubleshoot any issues that arise during testing.

  - `find_user_by_email(email)`: Find a user by email address
  - `get_active_users()`: Get all active users
  - `deactivate_user(user_id)`: Deactivate a user instead of deleting
