# Files Documentation

## test_code.py

### üìä Business Context & Impact
**Business Problem Statement:**
This code provides a simple user management system for testing AI analysis. It allows adding, finding, and deactivating users with email validation. The system helps in managing user data efficiently during AI analysis testing.

**Stakeholder Analysis:**
- Primary users: Developers and testers who need to manage user data for AI analysis testing.
- Secondary stakeholders: QA teams, data analysts, and AI researchers who benefit from accurate user data management.
- Integrates with: AI analysis systems, testing frameworks, and data processing tools.

### üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture
**System Design:**
- Follows a simple object-oriented design pattern with a UserManager class.
- No external dependencies beyond standard Python libraries.
- Can be integrated into larger systems for AI testing and analysis.

**Data Architecture:**
- Uses a list of dictionaries to store user data in memory.
- No database interactions for simplicity in testing scenarios.
- Implements email validation and user deactivation rules.

**Performance & Scalability:**
- Performance: Linear time complexity for user search and deactivation.
- Scalability: Limited by memory usage; can be optimized for larger datasets.
- Optimization: Potential improvements in search algorithms for large user sets.

### üíª Code Implementation Details
**Function/Class Documentation:**
- `UserManager`: Manages user data and operations.
- `add_user(name, email)`: Adds a new user with email validation.
- `get_user_by_id(user_id)`: Finds a user by ID.
- `find_user_by_email(email)`: Finds a user by email address.
- `get_active_users()`: Retrieves all active users.
- `deactivate_user(user_id)`: Deactivates a user instead of deleting.

**Code Examples & Usage:**
- Example usage provided in the file for adding users, searching by email, and deactivating users.
- Demonstrates basic user management operations.
- Follows Python best practices for exception handling and data manipulation.

**Security & Compliance:**
- Implements basic email validation for data integrity.
- No sensitive data storage or transmission; minimal security risks.
- Compliance: Can be extended to meet specific compliance requirements if needed.

### üîß Operations & Maintenance
**Deployment Considerations:**
- Requires Python environment for deployment.
- No specific configuration needs beyond standard Python setup.
- Monitoring: Basic logging can be added for tracking user operations.
