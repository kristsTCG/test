### 📊 Business Context & Impact
**Business Problem Statement:**
- This file provides a simple user management system for testing AI analysis, allowing for the creation, retrieval, deactivation, and listing of users.
- Addresses the need for managing user data efficiently during AI analysis testing.
- Enables the organization to simulate user interactions and behavior for AI testing purposes.
- Used by AI developers and testers to manage user data for testing scenarios.

**Stakeholder Analysis:**
- Primary users are AI developers and testers who need to manage user data for testing AI analysis.
- This code supports the testing phase of AI development, ensuring accurate simulation of user interactions.
- Integrates into the AI testing workflow, providing necessary user management functionalities.
- Ensures compliance with data protection regulations by enabling controlled user data management.

### 🏗️ Technical Architecture  
**System Design:**
- Follows a class-based architecture for user management functionalities.
- Implements object-oriented design principles for modularity and reusability.
- Relies on Python as the primary technology stack with no external dependencies.
- Integrates seamlessly with other components of the AI testing system.

**Data Architecture:**
- Utilizes a simple dictionary-based data model for user representation.
- No database interactions are performed; data is stored in-memory within the class instance.
- Implements basic data validation for email addresses.
- Input: User details for creation; Output: User data or None.

**Performance & Scalability:**
- Performance is efficient for small-scale user management.
- Scalability is limited due to in-memory storage and lack of persistence.
- Low resource usage (memory, CPU) for managing user data.
- No specific optimization strategies implemented due to the simplicity of the functionality.

### 💻 Code Implementation Details
**Function/Class Documentation:**
- `UserManager`: Manages user data including addition, retrieval, deactivation, and listing.
- `add_user(name, email)`: Adds a new user with email validation. Returns the created user.
- `get_user_by_id(user_id)`: Finds a user by ID. Returns the user or None.
- `find_user_by_email(email)`: Finds a user by email address. Returns the user or None.
- `get_active_users()`: Retrieves all active users. Returns a list of active users.
- `deactivate_user(user_id)`: Deactivates a user by setting 'active' to False. Returns True if successful, False
