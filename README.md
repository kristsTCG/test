### 📊 Business Context & Impact
**Business Problem Statement:**
- This file provides a simple user management system for testing AI analysis, allowing for the creation, retrieval, deactivation, and listing of users.
- It addresses the need for managing user data efficiently during AI analysis testing.
- The value delivered includes streamlined user data management for testing purposes, enabling better control and organization of user information.
- Developers and testers use this functionality to simulate user interactions and analyze AI behavior accurately.

**Stakeholder Analysis:**
- Primary users are developers and testers who need to manage user data for AI analysis testing.
- This file supports the testing process by providing user management capabilities crucial for accurate AI analysis.
- It fits into the larger workflow by facilitating the setup and control of user data for AI testing scenarios.
- Compliance requirements are not directly addressed by this code but can be extended to meet specific data privacy regulations.

### 🏗️ Technical Architecture  
**System Design:**
- The file follows a simple object-oriented design pattern with a class `UserManager` encapsulating user management functions.
- Design principles like encapsulation and separation of concerns are applied to ensure modularity and maintainability.
- Dependencies include Python standard libraries only, making it lightweight and easy to integrate.
- This file can be integrated into larger systems by providing a user management interface for AI testing components.

**Data Architecture:**
- Data models include user objects with attributes like id, name, email, and active status.
- No database interactions are performed; data is stored in-memory within the `UserManager` instance.
- Data validation ensures email format correctness, and business rules include user activation/deactivation logic.
- Input includes user details for creation, and output includes user information or lists of active users.

**Performance & Scalability:**
- Performance is efficient for managing a moderate number of users due to in-memory data storage.
- Scalability considerations may arise with a large number of users, potentially requiring optimizations like database integration.
- Resource usage is minimal, with memory consumption increasing linearly with the number of users.
- Optimization strategies could involve implementing pagination for large user datasets.

### 💻 Code Implementation Details
**Function/Class Documentation:**
- `UserManager` class manages user data with functions for adding, finding, listing active users, and deactivating users.
- Functions take input parameters like name, email, or user ID and return user objects or boolean values.
- Error handling
