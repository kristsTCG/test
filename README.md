## Key Files
- `test_code.py`: This file is the main script for running test cases. It contains functions and assertions to verify the correctness of the software's functionalities.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Open the `test_code.py` file in a Python IDE or text editor.
2. Review the existing test cases and functions defined in the file.
3. Modify or add new test cases as needed to cover different scenarios.
4. Run the script using a Python interpreter to execute the test cases and check the results.
5. Analyze the output to identify any failures or issues in the software's behavior.

- `get_user_by_id(user_id)`: Method to find a user by ID.
- `find_user_by_email(email)`: Method to find a user by email address.
- `get_active_users()`: Method to retrieve all active users.
- `deactivate_user(user_id)`: Method to deactivate a user without deleting.

**Usage:** To use this file, you can create an instance of `UserManager` and call its methods to manage users. The example usage at the end of the file demonstrates how to add users, search for a user by email, get active users, and deactivate a user.
