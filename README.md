# Folder Documentation

## Overview
This folder contains a single Python file, `test_code.py`, which is an essential part of the project. The purpose of this folder is to house the code for testing specific functionalities or components of the software project.

## Structure
The folder has a simple structure with only one Python file, `test_code.py`, present at the root level. This file is responsible for executing test cases and verifying the correctness of the implemented features.

## Key Files
- `test_code.py`: This file is crucial for testing various aspects of the software project. It contains test cases, assertions, and setup/teardown functions to ensure the functionality of the project components.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Open the `test_code.py` file in a Python IDE or text editor.
2. Review the existing test cases and modify them as needed to cover new functionalities or edge cases.
3. Run the test cases using a testing framework like pytest or unittest to verify the correctness of the project components.
4. Analyze the test results and debug any failures to ensure the project's stability and reliability.

Remember to maintain the integrity of the test cases and update them as the project evolves to guarantee consistent performance.

  - `add_user(name, email)`: Adds a new user with email validation
  - `get_user_by_id(user_id)`: Finds a user by ID
  - `find_user_by_email(email)`: Finds a user by email address
  - `get_active_users()`: Retrieves all active users
  - `deactivate_user(user_id)`: Deactivates a user instead of deleting

**Usage:** Execute the file to create a `UserManager` instance and interact with user management functions. Example usage is provided within the file.
