## test_code.py

### üìä Business Context & Impact
**Business Problem Statement:**
This code file provides a simple user management system for testing AI analysis. It allows adding users with email validation, finding users by ID or email, getting active users, and deactivating users without deleting their data. The system helps in managing user data efficiently for testing purposes.

**Stakeholder Analysis:**
- Primary users: Developers, testers, and analysts who need to manage user data for AI analysis testing.
- Secondary stakeholders: QA teams, data analysts, and project managers who benefit from streamlined user data management.
- Business processes: Integrates with AI analysis testing workflows, enhancing data management capabilities.

### üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture
**System Design:**
- Follows object-oriented design principles with a UserManager class for user management operations.
- Technology stack: Python programming language.
- Integration points: Can be integrated with AI analysis testing frameworks or data analysis tools.

**Data Architecture:**
- Data models: User data stored as dictionaries with ID, name, email, and active status.
- Database interactions: No external database used; data stored in memory.
- Data validation: Email validation ensures data integrity and accuracy.

**Performance & Scalability:**
- Performance: Operations like adding users, finding users, and deactivating users are efficient for small-scale testing.
- Scalability: Limited scalability due to in-memory data storage; may require modifications for large-scale use.
- Optimization: Code can be optimized for better performance by implementing caching mechanisms or using a database for data storage.

### üíª Code Implementation Details
**Function/Class Documentation:**
- `UserManager`: Manages user data with methods for adding users, finding users, getting active users, and deactivating users.
- Inputs/Outputs: Methods take user data as input and return user information or status.
- Error handling: Raises ValueError for invalid email addresses.
- Side effects: Modifies user data within the class instance.

**Code Examples & Usage:**
- Example usage provided in the file demonstrates adding users, finding users by email, and deactivating users.
- Integration: Can be integrated into testing scripts or AI analysis workflows for user data management.
- Best practices: Follows Python conventions for class and method naming, error handling, and data manipulation.

**Security & Compliance:**
- Security: No specific security measures mentioned; data validation helps prevent invalid user data.
- Data protection: No sensitive
