- `add_user(name, email)`: Method to add a new user with email validation.
- `get_user_by_id(user_id)`: Method to find a user by ID.
- `find_user_by_email(email)`: Method to find a user by email address.
- `get_active_users()`: Method to get all active users.
- `deactivate_user(user_id)`: Method to deactivate a user instead of deleting.

**Usage:** 
1. Instantiate `UserManager`: `manager = UserManager()`
2. Add users: `manager.add_user("John Doe", "john@example.com")`
3. Find user by email: `manager.find_user_by_email("john@example.com")`
