# Folder Documentation

## Overview
This folder contains a single Python file named `test_code.py`. The purpose of this folder in the project is to house a script for testing specific functionalities or components of the software.

## Structure
The folder structure is simple, with only one Python file present. The file `test_code.py` is responsible for executing test cases and validating the expected behavior of certain parts of the software.

## Key Files
- **test_code.py**: This file is the main component of the folder. It contains the test cases and assertions to verify the functionality of the software components.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Open the `test_code.py` file in a Python IDE or text editor.
2. Review the existing test cases and assertions to understand the expected behavior.
3. Modify or add new test cases as needed to cover different scenarios.
4. Run the `test_code.py` file to execute the test cases and verify the software components' functionality.
5. Analyze the test results to ensure that the software behaves as expected.

Remember to update the test cases in `test_code.py` whenever there are changes in the software components to maintain accurate testing coverage.
