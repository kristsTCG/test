  - `get_user_by_id(user_id)`: Finds a user by ID.
  - `find_user_by_email(email)`: Finds a user by email address.
  - `get_active_users()`: Retrieves all active users.
  - `deactivate_user(user_id)`: Deactivates a user without deleting.

**Usage:** Run the file to create a `UserManager` instance and use its methods to manage users. Example usage is provided at the end of the file.
