# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python file handles the authentication process for users. It manages user login, registration, and authentication logic within the project.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules and functions.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to grasp the authentication logic and user management processes.
3. Make necessary modifications or enhancements to suit the project's specific authentication requirements.
4. Ensure that any changes made adhere to the existing validation rules and authentication logic to maintain system security and integrity.
