## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` contains two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters that handles user input validation.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters responsible for user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Role**: Handles user input validation.
- **Character Count**: 1212
- **Description**: This file contains functions to validate user input data, ensuring it meets the required criteria before processing.

### auth.py
- **Role**: Manages user authentication processes.
- **Character Count**: 2198
- **Description**: This Python file is responsible for authenticating users, verifying their identity, and managing access control within the application.

## Usage
1. To utilize the user input validation functionality:
   - Open `validator.js`.
   - Use the provided functions to validate user input data before processing it further.

2. To implement user authentication processes:
   - Access `auth.py`.
   - Utilize the functions within this file to authenticate users, verify their identity, and manage access control within the application.

Ensure to integrate these files appropriately within the project to enable secure user authentication mechanisms.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength evaluation.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates an email address based on a regular expression pattern.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates a password based on specific criteria (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates a username based on specific criteria (3-20 characters, alphanumeric and underscores only).
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Evaluates the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation methods in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization/deserialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
