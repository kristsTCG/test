# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication operations efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user inputs and ensuring data integrity during the authentication process.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file consists of 2198 characters and manages the authentication logic, including user login, registration, and session management.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review `validator.js` for input validation rules and customize them as needed.
2. Explore `auth.py` to understand the authentication flow and make any necessary modifications to suit the project requirements.
3. Ensure that both files are integrated correctly with other components that interact with user authentication functionalities.
