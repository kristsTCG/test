# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate the validation logic in `validator.js` written in JavaScript and the authentication logic in `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: Contains the user validation logic with 1212 characters. It is responsible for validating user input data.
- **auth.py**: Contains the user authentication logic with 2198 characters. This file handles user authentication processes such as login, logout, and session management.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed by updating the logic within this file.
   - Ensure that user input data meets the specified validation criteria before proceeding with authentication.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Use the functions provided in this file to implement user authentication features in the project.
   - Customize the authentication process according to project requirements by modifying the code in this file.

Ensure that both files are integrated correctly within the project to maintain secure user authentication processes.
