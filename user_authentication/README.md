# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized with two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file containing functions for validating user input. (1212 characters)
- `auth.py`: A Python file handling authentication processes. (2198 characters)

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file is crucial for ensuring that user input meets the required criteria. It contains various validation functions to check input data before processing.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is responsible for managing user authentication within the project. It handles processes such as user login, registration, and authentication checks.

## Usage
1. To use the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the necessary functions into your JavaScript files and call them as needed to validate user input.
2. For authentication processes, utilize the functions and methods defined in `auth.py` to handle user login, registration, and authentication checks within your Python code.

Ensure to follow the documentation and comments within each file for a better understanding of the functions and methods available for user authentication.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates a password based on specific criteria (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates a username for length (3-20 characters) and alphanumeric characters with underscores only.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** This file can be imported using `require` or `import` statements to access the `InputValidator` class and its validation methods.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session using the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided by the methods within the class.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For handling JSON data.
- `datetime`: For working with date and time.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
