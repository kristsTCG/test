## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This module is responsible for validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` consists of two key files:
- `validator.js` (JavaScript): Contains functions for validating user input data.
- `auth.py` (Python): Implements authentication logic and user management.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- Role: Handles validation of user input data.
- Size: 1212 characters
- Language: JavaScript

### auth.py
- Role: Manages user authentication processes and user data.
- Size: 2198 characters
- Language: Python

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the module and call the necessary validation functions on user input data.
2. For authentication processes and user management, interact with the functions provided in `auth.py`. Ensure to handle user authentication securely and manage user data appropriately.
