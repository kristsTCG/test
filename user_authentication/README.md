# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder contains two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters that handles user input validation.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters responsible for user authentication logic.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Role**: Handles user input validation.
- **Character Count**: 1212
- **Usage**: Ensures that user input meets specified criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.

### auth.py
- **Role**: Manages user authentication logic.
- **Character Count**: 2198
- **Usage**: Implements authentication processes such as verifying user credentials and granting access.

## Usage
1. To utilize the user input validation functionality, refer to the `validator.js` file. Modify the validation criteria as needed to suit the project requirements.
2. For user authentication processes, interact with the `auth.py` file. Implement additional authentication logic or customize the existing logic to align with the project's authentication requirements.
