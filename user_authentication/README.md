# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This module is responsible for validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` contains two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters, responsible for input validation.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters, handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- Role: Handles input validation for user data.
- Size: 1212 characters
- Language: JavaScript

### auth.py
- Role: Manages user authentication processes.
- Size: 2198 characters
- Language: Python

## Usage
1. To use the input validation functionality, refer to `validator.js`. This file contains functions for validating user input such as email addresses, passwords, and other relevant data.
2. For user authentication processes, utilize `auth.py`. This file includes functions for user login, registration, password reset, and other authentication-related tasks.
3. Ensure to integrate these files into the project's authentication flow to provide secure and reliable user authentication mechanisms.
