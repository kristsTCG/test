# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication tasks within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the functionality provided in this folder:
1. Review the code in `validator.js` to understand the validation logic and criteria.
2. Explore `auth.py` to familiarize yourself with the user authentication processes implemented in Python.
3. Integrate these files into your project to enable user authentication features.

Ensure that you follow the guidelines and best practices outlined in the code documentation for seamless integration and usage.
