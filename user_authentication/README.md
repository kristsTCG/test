# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It includes a JavaScript file for validation logic and a Python file for handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side validation and auth.py for server-side authentication.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring data integrity and security on the client side.
   
2. **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` handles server-side authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication against the backend system.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to suit the project requirements.
   - Include `validator.js` in your HTML files using `<script>` tags to enable client-side validation.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Integrate `auth.py` with your backend system to handle user authentication.
   - Utilize the functions in `auth.py` for user login, registration, and authentication processes.

Ensure proper coordination between client-side validation (validator.js) and server-side authentication (auth.py) for a seamless user authentication experience.
