# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles tasks such as validating user input and managing user authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate the validation logic in `validator.js` (JavaScript) and the authentication logic in `auth.py` (Python). Both files work together to ensure secure user authentication processes.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains the JavaScript code for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that the data provided by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
  
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file contains Python code responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages tasks such as user login, registration, and authentication verification.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to match the project's requirements.
   - Import and use the validation functions in other parts of the project where user input validation is required.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Implement additional authentication functionalities as needed, such as password reset or account verification.
   - Integrate the authentication logic with other parts of the project that require user authentication.

Ensure that both files are properly integrated into the project to maintain secure user authentication processes.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file contains input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of being at least 8 characters long with uppercase, lowercase, and a number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is between 3-20 characters long and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of the input password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** This file can be imported into other JavaScript files using `require` or `import` statements to perform input validation for user authentication.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies are required for this file.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class managing user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to use the provided authentication functionalities.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: Used for hashing passwords.
- `json`: Used for JSON operations.
- `datetime`: Used for date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: Used for time calculations.
- `typing`: Used for type hints.
