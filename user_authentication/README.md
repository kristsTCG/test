# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This module is responsible for validating user input and handling user authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` contains two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters, responsible for validating user input data.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters, responsible for handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
The `validator.js` file is crucial for ensuring that user input data is valid before proceeding with authentication processes. It contains functions to validate user input such as email addresses, passwords, and other relevant data.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is essential for managing user authentication within the project. It handles processes such as user login, registration, password reset, and authentication token generation.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Use the functions provided in `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing authentication.
2. Utilize the functions in `auth.py` to implement user authentication processes such as login, registration, and password reset.
3. Ensure that the code in these files is integrated correctly with other parts of the project that require user authentication functionalities.
