## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes the following key components:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters responsible for validating user input data.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters that handle user authentication logic.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Role**: Responsible for validating user input data.
- **Character Count**: 1212

### auth.py
- **Role**: Handles user authentication logic.
- **Character Count**: 2198

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Modify the `validator.js` file to customize user input validation rules.
2. Update the `auth.py` file to enhance user authentication processes.
3. Ensure to maintain the integrity of the authentication system while making changes to these files.

- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is 3-20 characters long and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** This file can be imported into other JavaScript files using `require` or `import` statements to perform input validation for user authentication.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
