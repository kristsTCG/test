The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` contains two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters responsible for user input validation.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters that manages user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Role**: Handles user input validation.
- **Size**: 1212 characters
- **Usage**: Ensures that user input meets specified criteria before processing.

### auth.py
- **Role**: Manages user authentication processes.
- **Size**: 2198 characters
- **Usage**: Handles user login, registration, and authentication tasks.

## Usage
1. To utilize the user input validation functionality:
   - Open `validator.js`.
   - Review the validation rules and criteria.
   - Integrate the validation functions into the appropriate parts of the project.

2. To work with user authentication processes:
   - Access `auth.py`.
   - Implement the necessary functions for user login, registration, and authentication.
   - Ensure that the authentication logic aligns with the project's requirements.
