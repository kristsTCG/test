# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This functionality is responsible for validating user input and managing user authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized with two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters, responsible for validating user input data.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters, responsible for handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
The `validator.js` file is crucial for ensuring that user input data is validated before being processed further. It contains functions for validating various types of user input, such as email addresses, passwords, and other form data.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is essential for managing user authentication processes within the project. It handles tasks such as user login, registration, password hashing, and token generation for secure authentication.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code and call the appropriate validation functions with the user input data.
2. To incorporate user authentication processes from `auth.py` into your Python code, import the file and utilize the provided functions for user login, registration, and other authentication tasks.

Ensure that you follow the guidelines and best practices outlined in the respective files to maintain secure and efficient user authentication within the project.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Assesses the strength of a password based on length and character requirements.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class in your code and call the validation functions as needed.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and hashed password.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token if successful.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the provided session token.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
