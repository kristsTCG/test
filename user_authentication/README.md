# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` for client-side input validation written in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication logic written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation functions to ensure that user input meets specified criteria before submission.
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file handles server-side authentication processes, such as user login, registration, and token generation.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation functions as needed to match the input requirements of the project.
   - Include the `validator.js` file in your HTML templates using a script tag.
   - Call the validation functions on user input events (e.g., form submission) to validate user input.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Customize the authentication logic to integrate with your project's user management system.
   - Import the `auth.py` file in your main application file to access the authentication functionalities.
   - Use the provided functions for user registration, login, and token generation as required.

Ensure to test the user authentication functionalities thoroughly to maintain the security and integrity of user data in your project.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file provides a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token for active sessions.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session based on the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints (not used in this file).
