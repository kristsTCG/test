## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python. These files are responsible for user input validation and user authentication, respectively.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**:
   - Language: JavaScript
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Role: Handles user input validation to ensure data integrity and security.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Language: Python
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Role: Manages user authentication processes, such as login, logout, and session management.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - To use the validation functions provided in `validator.js`, import the module into your JavaScript files using `require` or `import`.
   - Call the appropriate validation functions on user input data to ensure it meets the required criteria.

2. **auth.py**:
   - To utilize the authentication functionalities in `auth.py`, import the module into your Python scripts.
   - Use the provided functions for user login, logout, and session management as needed in your application.
