# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input data related to authentication. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python file is 2198 characters long and handles the authentication logic for users. It verifies user credentials and manages the authentication process within the system.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules for user input data.
2. Examine the `auth.py` file to understand how user authentication is implemented in the project.
3. Make necessary modifications or enhancements to the validation and authentication logic as needed.
4. Ensure that any changes made adhere to the project's authentication requirements and security standards.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user authentication operations.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by providing the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication system. Call the methods within the class to register users, log in, log out, and check authentication status.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: for hashing functions.
- `json`: for JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: for working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: for calculating time differences.
- `typing`: for type hints.
