# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` for client-side input validation in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic written in JavaScript. It ensures that user input meets specified criteria before submitting to the server for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is responsible for server-side authentication using Python. It handles user login, registration, and authentication processes securely on the server side.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to suit the project requirements.
   - Include the `validator.js` file in the appropriate HTML pages to enable client-side validation.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Implement additional authentication logic as required by the project.
   - Integrate the authentication functionalities provided in `auth.py` with other parts of the project that require user authentication.

Ensure that both client-side and server-side authentication processes are in sync to provide a seamless user experience.
