# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side input validation and auth.py for server-side authentication logic.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation functions to ensure that user input meets specified criteria before submission.
- **auth.py**: The Python file auth.py handles server-side authentication processes, such as verifying user credentials and managing user sessions.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Import the validator.js file into your HTML document using `<script>` tags.
   - Utilize the provided validation functions to validate user input fields before form submission.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Integrate auth.py into your server-side codebase to handle user authentication processes.
   - Use the functions within auth.py to authenticate users, manage sessions, and enforce security measures.

Ensure that both client-side and server-side authentication components work together seamlessly to provide a secure and user-friendly authentication experience.
