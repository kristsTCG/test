# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for authentication processes.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This file is responsible for validating user input data to ensure it meets the required criteria before processing it further.
- `auth.py`: This file contains the authentication logic for verifying user credentials and granting access to authorized users.

## Usage
1. To utilize the input validation functionality, refer to `validator.js` and incorporate the validation methods into your code where necessary.
2. For user authentication processes, utilize `auth.py` by importing the necessary functions and integrating them into your authentication workflow.
3. Ensure to follow the guidelines and comments within each file for seamless integration and proper usage.
