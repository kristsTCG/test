- Role: Responsible for validating user inputs.
- Size: 1212 characters
- Language: JavaScript

### auth.py
- Role: Manages user authentication processes.
- Size: 2198 characters
- Language: Python

## Usage
1. To work with the input validation functionality, refer to `validator.js`. This file contains the logic for validating user inputs such as email addresses, passwords, etc.
2. For user authentication processes, utilize `auth.py`. This file includes functions for user login, registration, password reset, and other authentication-related tasks.
