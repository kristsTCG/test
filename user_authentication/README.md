# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This component is responsible for validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate the validation logic in `validator.js` written in JavaScript and the authentication functionality in `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains the validation logic for user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file handles the authentication process for users. It manages user login, registration, and authentication tasks within the system.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality, refer to `validator.js` and integrate the validation methods into your user input forms or data processing logic.
   
2. For user authentication tasks such as login and registration, interact with the functions provided in `auth.py`. Ensure to follow the authentication flow defined within the file for secure user access control.
