# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` contains two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters responsible for validating user input.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
The `validator.js` file is crucial for ensuring that user input meets specified criteria and is safe for processing within the application. It plays a key role in maintaining data integrity and security.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is responsible for managing user authentication within the project. It handles processes such as user login, registration, and authentication checks. This file is essential for ensuring secure access to the application.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review `validator.js` to understand the validation rules applied to user input.
2. Explore `auth.py` to understand how user authentication processes are managed within the project.
3. Modify and extend the functionality as needed, ensuring that any changes adhere to security best practices and project requirements.
