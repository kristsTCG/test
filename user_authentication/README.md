# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user inputs and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic for user inputs. It ensures that the data entered by users meets the required criteria before submission.
  
- **auth.py**: This file contains server-side authentication logic written in Python. It manages user authentication, login, and authorization processes within the application.

## Usage
1. To utilize the client-side validation provided by `validator.js`, include the script in your HTML file and call the necessary functions to validate user inputs before form submission.

2. To implement server-side authentication using `auth.py`, import the file into your Python project and utilize the authentication functions provided to handle user login and authorization processes.

3. Ensure to customize the validation criteria and authentication logic according to your project requirements for secure user authentication.
