# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It includes validation logic in JavaScript and authentication logic in Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks. It contains two key files: `validator.js` for input validation and `auth.py` for authentication processes.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains logic for validating user inputs. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is written in Python and handles user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication tasks within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the code in this folder:
1. Review `validator.js` to understand the input validation logic and make any necessary adjustments to suit your project requirements.
2. Explore `auth.py` to familiarize yourself with the authentication processes implemented in Python.
3. Integrate these files into your project to enable user authentication functionalities.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email follows a standard email format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and a number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is 3-20 characters long and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on its length and character composition.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file and use its static methods for input validation tasks.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by deleting the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For handling JSON data.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
