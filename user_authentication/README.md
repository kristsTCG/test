# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` for client-side input validation in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication logic in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic to ensure that user input meets specified criteria before sending it to the server for authentication.
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is responsible for handling server-side authentication processes. It includes functions for user login, registration, and authentication.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to suit the project requirements.
   - Include the `validator.js` file in your HTML pages using `<script>` tags to enable client-side validation.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Import the `auth.py` module in your Python application to utilize the authentication functionalities.
   - Use the provided functions for user login, registration, and authentication processes.

Ensure that both client-side and server-side authentication processes are in sync to provide a secure and seamless user experience.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates a password based on length and character requirements.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates a username for length and character restrictions.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on various criteria.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session by invalidating the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication processes.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
