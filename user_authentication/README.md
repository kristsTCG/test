# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file consists of 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python file contains 2198 characters and focuses on the authentication logic for users. It handles the process of verifying user credentials and granting access to authorized users.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to suit the project requirements.
   - Import the `validator.js` file into other modules where user input validation is required.
   - Ensure that the validation logic aligns with the project's security standards.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Implement additional authentication methods or strategies based on project needs.
   - Integrate the authentication logic with other parts of the project that require user authentication.
   - Secure sensitive information such as passwords and tokens within the authentication process.

By following the guidelines above, developers can effectively utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in the `user_authentication` folder.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates an email address based on a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates a password based on length and character requirements.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates a username based on length and character requirements.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character complexity.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class in your code and call the respective validation functions or password strength function as needed.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the provided session token.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For handling JSON data.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing.Optional`: For defining optional return types.
- `typing.Dict`: For defining dictionary types.
