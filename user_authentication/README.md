# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It is responsible for validating user input and handling user authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input related to authentication. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file is 2198 characters long and handles the actual authentication process. It verifies user credentials, generates tokens, and manages user sessions.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
- Modify `validator.js` to customize the validation rules for user input.
- Update `auth.py` to enhance or modify the authentication logic as needed.
- Ensure that both files work together seamlessly to provide a secure and reliable user authentication system.
