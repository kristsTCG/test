# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It ensures that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submission.
   
2. `auth.py`: This file implements server-side authentication functionalities using Python. It manages user authentication, login, and session handling.

## Usage
1. To utilize the client-side validation logic, refer to `validator.js`. Modify the validation rules as needed to suit the project's requirements.
   
2. For server-side authentication tasks, interact with `auth.py`. Implement additional authentication features or customize existing ones based on project needs.

Ensure that both client-side and server-side authentication processes are in sync to provide a seamless user experience and secure authentication flow.
