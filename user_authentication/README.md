# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` and `auth.py`, which are responsible for validating user input and handling authentication processes, respectively.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It includes functions for user login, registration, and authentication checks. The logic implemented in this file is essential for securing user accounts and managing access to the system.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules applied to user input data.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to familiarize yourself with the authentication logic and functions available for user management.
3. Integrate these files into the project's authentication system as needed, ensuring proper error handling and security measures are in place.
