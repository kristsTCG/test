## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and a number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is between 3-20 characters long and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of the input password based on its length and character composition.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the provided validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization and deserialization.
