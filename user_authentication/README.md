# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains the JavaScript code for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is written in Python and is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication logic within the project.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**: To use the `validator.js` file, you can import it into your JavaScript files using `import validator from './validator.js'`. Then, utilize the functions provided in the file to validate user input data before processing it further.

2. **auth.py**: In order to utilize the functionalities provided by `auth.py`, you can import it into your Python scripts using `import auth`. You can then call the necessary functions within `auth.py` to handle user authentication tasks such as login, registration, and authentication.

Ensure that you follow the documentation within each file to understand the specific functions and methods available for user authentication in the project.
