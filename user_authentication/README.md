# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
- **auth.py**: This Python file handles the authentication logic for users. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the system.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - To use the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code.
   - Call the appropriate validation functions with user input data to ensure its correctness before proceeding with authentication processes.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Import `auth.py` into your Python code to access the authentication functionalities.
   - Utilize the provided functions in `auth.py` for user registration, login, and authentication tasks within your application.

Ensure to follow the documentation within each file for specific usage instructions and function details.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength level of a password based on various criteria.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in other parts of the application.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the session token.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing.Optional`: For type hinting.
