# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This functionality is responsible for validating user input and managing user authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized with two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters, responsible for validating user input related to authentication.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters, responsible for handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file contains functions for validating user input related to authentication, ensuring that the input meets the required criteria for authentication processes.

### auth.py
This file handles user authentication processes, including verifying user credentials, generating authentication tokens, and managing user sessions.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation logic for user input.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to understand how user authentication processes are implemented.
3. Modify the code as needed to customize authentication logic or integrate with other parts of the project.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password and returns a descriptive level.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** User authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
- `hash_password()`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user()`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login()`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token for active sessions.
- `logout()`: Method to end a user session by removing the session token.
- `is_authenticated()`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to manage user authentication operations. Call `register_user()` to register a new user, `login()` to authenticate and get a session token, `logout()` to end a session, and `is_authenticated()` to check session validity.

**Dependencies:** `hashlib`, `json`, `datetime`, `timedelta`, `Optional`, `Dict` (from `typing` module).
