# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the data provided by the user meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.

2. **auth.py**: This Python file is 2198 characters long and manages the authentication logic for users. It handles user login, registration, and authentication processes using Python programming language.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules applied to user input data.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to understand the authentication logic implemented for user login and registration.
3. Modify the code as needed to customize user authentication processes according to project requirements.
4. Ensure to test the changes thoroughly to maintain the security and integrity of user authentication functionalities.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric and underscore characters.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on various criteria.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password()`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user()`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login()`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token for active sessions.
- `logout()`: Method to end a user session by invalidating the session token.
- `is_authenticated()`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class and use its methods to register users, authenticate logins, manage sessions, and check authentication status.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints (not used in this file).
