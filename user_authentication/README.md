# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This module handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains code for validating user inputs and ensuring data integrity during the authentication process. It plays a crucial role in validating user credentials before proceeding with authentication.

2. **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication logic. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes using Python programming language.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file for user input validation logic.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to understand the user authentication flow and processes.
3. Modify the code as needed to customize user authentication functionalities for the project.
4. Ensure to maintain data security and integrity while handling user authentication tasks.

- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric and underscore characters.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password and returns a descriptive level.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.

- `logout`: Method to end a user session by invalidating the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:**
