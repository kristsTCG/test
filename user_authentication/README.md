# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file handles the authentication processes for users. It manages user login, registration, and verification within the system.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
- Review `validator.js` for input validation logic and make necessary adjustments to suit project requirements.
- Explore `auth.py` to understand the authentication flow and customize it as needed for the project.
- Ensure that both files are integrated correctly with other components that interact with user authentication functionalities.
