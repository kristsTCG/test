# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This functionality is responsible for validating user input and managing user authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for managing user authentication processes. It handles tasks such as user login, registration, and authentication verification.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionality in this folder, developers can refer to the `validator.js` file for input validation logic and the `auth.py` file for user authentication processes. Developers should integrate these files into the project's authentication system as needed. Additionally, they can extend or modify the existing functionality to suit specific project requirements.
