# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This file contains JavaScript code for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
   
2. `auth.py`: The `auth.py` file is written in Python and is responsible for handling user authentication logic. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in the `user_authentication` folder, follow these steps:
1. Use the `validator.js` file to validate user input data before processing it for authentication.
2. Utilize the `auth.py` file to implement user authentication features such as login, registration, and authentication within the project.

Ensure that you integrate these files seamlessly into your project to enhance user authentication security and functionality.
