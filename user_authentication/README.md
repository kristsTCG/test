# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized with two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python. These files handle user input validation and authentication processes, respectively.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the data provided by the user meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
  
- `auth.py`: This Python file contains 2198 characters and handles the authentication logic for users. It verifies user credentials and grants access based on the authentication process implemented.

## Usage
To utilize the functionality provided in this folder:
1. Review `validator.js` for input validation requirements and customize as needed.
2. Understand the authentication logic implemented in `auth.py` to integrate user authentication into the project.
3. Ensure proper error handling and security measures are in place when working with user authentication processes.

- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py
