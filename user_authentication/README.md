# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input data related to authentication processes. It ensures that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file, 2198 characters long, handles the actual authentication logic. It verifies user credentials and manages the authentication flow within the system.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review `validator.js` to understand the validation rules for user input data.
2. Examine `auth.py` to understand the authentication logic and flow within the system.
3. Make necessary modifications or enhancements to the validation and authentication processes as needed for your project.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and a number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is between 3-20 characters long and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on its length and character composition.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use its validation and password strength functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the session token.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to use the provided authentication functionalities.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: For handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
