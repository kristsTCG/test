# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes a JavaScript file for validation logic (`validator.js`) and a Python file for authentication (`auth.py`).

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This file contains JavaScript code for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria.
  
- `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication within the system.

## Usage
To utilize the functionality provided in this folder:
1. Use the `validator.js` file to validate user input before processing it further.
2. Utilize the `auth.py` file to manage user authentication tasks such as login and registration processes.

Ensure that you integrate these files into your project's authentication flow to enhance security and user experience.
