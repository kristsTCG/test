# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` for client-side validation written in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This file contains client-side validation logic for user inputs. It ensures that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submitting it to the server for authentication.
   
2. `auth.py`: The `auth.py` file is responsible for server-side authentication processes. It handles user login, registration, and authentication using Python. This file interacts with the database to verify user credentials and manage user sessions.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionalities in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Use the `validator.js` file to implement client-side validation for user inputs on the frontend.
2. Incorporate the `auth.py` file into the backend to handle user authentication processes, including login, registration, and session management.
3. Ensure that the necessary dependencies and configurations are set up to support user authentication features in the project.

- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on various criteria.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in other parts of the application.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
