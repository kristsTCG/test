# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. This includes validation of user inputs and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user inputs. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
  
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file contains authentication logic written in Python. It handles user authentication processes, such as verifying user credentials and generating authentication tokens.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions provided in `validator.js`, import the necessary functions into your JavaScript files using `import` or `require` statements.
   
2. In Python scripts requiring user authentication functionalities, import the `auth.py` module and utilize its functions for user authentication tasks.

3. Ensure to follow the documentation within each file for specific usage instructions and function parameters.

By leveraging the functionalities within the `user_authentication` folder, developers can implement secure user authentication processes in their project.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username allowing only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength level of a password based on various criteria.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class where input validation is required.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies required.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, logout, and session validation.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session by invalidating the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Import the `UserAuth` class from this file to handle user authentication in your Python application.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
