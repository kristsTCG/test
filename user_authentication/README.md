# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` and `auth.py`, written in JavaScript and Python respectively.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.

2. `auth.py`: This Python file, 2198 characters in length, handles the authentication logic for users. It manages the verification of user credentials and grants access based on the authentication rules defined within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation criteria for user input.
2. Examine the `auth.py` file to comprehend the authentication process and rules implemented within the project.
3. Modify or extend the code in these files as needed to customize user authentication processes for your project.
