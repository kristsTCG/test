## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` contains two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters responsible for validating user input.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Role**: Responsible for validating user input.
- **Character Count**: 1212

### auth.py
- **Role**: Handles user authentication processes.
- **Character Count**: 2198

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality, refer to `validator.js` and integrate the validation logic into your user input forms.
2. For user authentication processes, utilize `auth.py` to authenticate users within the system.
3. Ensure to maintain the integrity and security of user authentication by following best practices outlined in the code files.
