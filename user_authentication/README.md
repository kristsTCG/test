# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file consists of 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the data provided by users meet the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file contains 2198 characters and handles the authentication logic for users. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the system.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
- Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation criteria for user input.
- Explore the `auth.py` file to grasp the authentication processes and methods available for user management.
- Integrate these files into the project's authentication system as needed, ensuring proper error handling and security measures are in place.
