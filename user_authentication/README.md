# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` contains two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters, responsible for validating user input.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters, handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file is crucial for ensuring that user input meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes. It contains functions for validating user data such as email addresses, passwords, and other input fields.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is responsible for managing user authentication within the project. It handles processes such as user login, registration, and authentication checks. This file interacts with the database to verify user credentials and grant access to authorized users.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionalities, refer to the `validator.js` file and import the necessary functions into your code.
2. For user authentication processes, utilize the functions provided in the `auth.py` file. Ensure that the required parameters are passed to the functions for successful authentication.
3. Make sure to handle error cases and exceptions appropriately when working with the user authentication functionalities in this folder.
