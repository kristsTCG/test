# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This module is responsible for validating user input and handling user authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` consists of two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python. These files are essential for user input validation and authentication logic.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.

2. `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication logic. It includes functions for user login, registration, and authentication processes. This file interacts with the database to verify user credentials and manage user sessions.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in the `user_authentication` folder, follow these steps:
1. Use the functions defined in `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing authentication requests.
2. Import and utilize the functions from `auth.py` to handle user authentication processes such as user login, registration, and session management.
3. Ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed and configured to enable seamless operation of the user authentication module.
