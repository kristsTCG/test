# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` and `auth.py`, written in JavaScript and Python, respectively.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the data entered by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.

2. **auth.py**: This Python file, 2198 characters long, handles the authentication logic for users. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the system.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
- Review `validator.js` to understand the validation rules applied to user input.
- Examine `auth.py` to understand the authentication logic implemented for user interactions.
- Modify and extend the code as needed to customize user authentication processes in the project.
