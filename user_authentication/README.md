## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input data related to authentication processes.
- **auth.py**: This Python file is 2198 characters long and handles the authentication logic for users within the project.

## Usage
Developers can utilize the `validator.js` file to ensure that user input data for authentication meets the required criteria. The `auth.py` file can be used to implement authentication processes for users in the project. Ensure to follow the code structure and guidelines within each file for seamless integration with the project's authentication system.
