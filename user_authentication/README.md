# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder contains two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters responsible for user input validation.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters handling user authentication logic.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Role**: Responsible for validating user input data.
- **Character Count**: 1212
- **Usage**: Ensures that user input meets specified criteria before further processing.

### auth.py
- **Role**: Manages user authentication processes.
- **Character Count**: 2198
- **Usage**: Handles user login, registration, and authentication tasks.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality:
   - Open `validator.js` and review the validation rules.
   - Integrate the validation logic into the relevant parts of the project.

2. To work with user authentication:
   - Access `auth.py` to understand the authentication flow.
   - Implement the necessary calls to `auth.py` for user login and registration processes.

- `logout()`: Method to end a user session by removing the session token.
- `is_authenticated()`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
