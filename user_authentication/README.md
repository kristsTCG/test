# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It includes functions for verifying user credentials and managing user sessions.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder, you can directly interact with the `validator.js` and `auth.py` files. Ensure that you follow the documentation within each file to understand the specific functions and methods available for user authentication. Additionally, make sure to integrate these files into your project's authentication workflow as needed.
