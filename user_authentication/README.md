# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate the validation logic in `validator.js` written in JavaScript and the authentication logic in `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This file contains the validation logic for user input. It ensures that the data entered by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
- `auth.py`: This file handles the authentication process for users. It verifies user credentials and grants access based on the authentication rules defined in the project.

## Usage
1. To work with the validation logic, refer to `validator.js`. Customize the validation rules as needed to match the project requirements.
2. For authentication processes, utilize `auth.py`. Implement any additional authentication steps or rules specific to the project.
3. Ensure that both files are integrated correctly within the project to maintain secure user authentication processes.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets certain criteria (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username meets certain criteria (3-20 characters, alphanumeric and underscores only).
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** This file can be imported using `require` or `import` statements in other JavaScript files to perform input validation for user authentication.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session by invalidating the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints (not used in this file).
