# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input data for authentication purposes.
- **auth.py**: This Python file contains 2198 characters and handles the authentication logic for users within the system.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review `validator.js` to understand how user input data is validated.
2. Examine `auth.py` to understand the authentication logic implemented for users.
3. Make necessary modifications or enhancements to the authentication process as needed.
