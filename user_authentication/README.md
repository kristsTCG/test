# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript for client-side validation and `auth.py` written in Python for server-side authentication.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It ensures that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submission.
   
2. **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is responsible for server-side authentication processes. It manages user authentication, login, and authorization within the system.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
- Use `validator.js` to implement client-side validation for user input forms.
- Incorporate `auth.py` to handle server-side authentication processes, including user login and authorization.
- Ensure that both files are integrated correctly within the project to maintain secure user authentication mechanisms.

**Usage:** This file can be imported as a module in other JavaScript files by using `require` or `import` statements.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies are required for this file.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the session token.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For representing a duration of time.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
