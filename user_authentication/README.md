# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes validation logic in JavaScript and authentication logic in Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` for input validation and `auth.py` for user authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters of code responsible for validating user inputs. It ensures that the data entered by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python file contains 2198 characters of code dedicated to user authentication. It manages the process of verifying user credentials and granting access to authorized users.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to suit the project's requirements.
   - Integrate the validation logic into the user authentication flow to ensure data integrity.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Customize the authentication process based on the project's security needs.
   - Implement additional security measures such as two-factor authentication if required.

Ensure that both files work seamlessly together to provide a secure and reliable user authentication system.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character requirements.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use its validation methods in user authentication processes.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, logout, and session authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
