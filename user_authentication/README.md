# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It includes validation logic in JavaScript and authentication logic in Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication processes. It contains two key files, `validator.js` for input validation and `auth.py` for user authentication.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains logic for validating user inputs. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
  
- `auth.py`: This Python file handles user authentication processes. It includes functions for user login, registration, and other authentication-related tasks. 

## Usage
1. To use the validation logic in `validator.js`, import the necessary functions into your JavaScript files and call them to validate user inputs before processing them further.

2. For user authentication tasks, import the `auth.py` module into your Python scripts. Utilize the provided functions for user login, registration, and any other authentication-related operations required in your project.
