# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This module is responsible for validating user inputs and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` consists of two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file containing functions for validating user inputs.
- `auth.py`: A Python file implementing authentication logic.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Role**: Handles user input validation.
- **Size**: 1212 characters
- **Usage**: Ensures that user-provided data meets specified criteria before processing.

### auth.py
- **Role**: Manages user authentication processes.
- **Size**: 2198 characters
- **Usage**: Implements authentication logic such as user login, registration, and access control.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the necessary functions into your JavaScript files and call them as needed.
2. For authentication functionalities, interact with the methods defined in `auth.py` by importing the module and invoking the appropriate functions for user login, registration, and authorization.

Ensure to adhere to the defined validation rules and authentication processes to maintain security and integrity within the application.
