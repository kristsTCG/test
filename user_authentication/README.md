# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It contains logic for user login, registration, and authentication.

## Usage
To utilize the functionality provided in this folder:
- Use the functions defined in `validator.js` to validate user input before processing it for authentication.
- Incorporate the authentication logic from `auth.py` into your project to enable user registration, login, and authentication processes.
