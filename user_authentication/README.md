# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Language: JavaScript
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Role: Responsible for validating user input and ensuring data integrity during the authentication process.

2. **auth.py**
   - Language: Python
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Role: Manages user authentication, including login, logout, and session management using Python.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation logic implemented for user input.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to grasp the authentication mechanisms and session management techniques used in the project.
3. Integrate these files into your project to enable secure user authentication processes.

Remember to adhere to the coding standards and guidelines set in the project to maintain consistency across the codebase.
