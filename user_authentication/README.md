# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication features. It includes validator.js for client-side validation and auth.py for server-side authentication logic.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation functions to ensure that user input meets specified criteria before submission.
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for server-side authentication processes, such as verifying user credentials and managing user sessions.

## Usage
1. To utilize the client-side validation functions, refer to `validator.js`. Modify or extend the validation rules as needed for your project requirements.
2. For server-side authentication tasks, interact with `auth.py`. Implement additional authentication logic or integrate it with other parts of the project as necessary.
