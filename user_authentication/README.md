# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized with two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file containing functions for validating user input data. (1212 characters)
- `auth.py`: A Python file responsible for handling user authentication processes. (2198 characters)

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file contains functions to validate user input data, ensuring data integrity and security.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file manages user authentication processes such as login, logout, and user session management.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code and call the necessary validation functions on user input data.
2. To implement user authentication features, import `auth.py` into your Python code and utilize the provided functions for user login, logout, and session management.
