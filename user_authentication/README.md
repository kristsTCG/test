# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It includes a JavaScript file for validation logic and a Python file for handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. The key components include a validator script for input validation and an authentication script for user login and verification.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js** (JavaScript)
   - Role: Handles input validation for user authentication forms.
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Importance: Ensures that user input meets specified criteria before processing.

2. **auth.py** (Python)
   - Role: Manages user authentication processes such as login and verification.
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Importance: Implements secure user authentication mechanisms within the project.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to suit the project requirements.
   - Integrate the validation logic into user input forms to enhance data integrity.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Utilize the authentication functions provided to handle user login and verification.
   - Customize the authentication process to align with the project's security standards.

Ensure that any changes made to the authentication scripts are thoroughly tested to maintain the integrity and security of user authentication within the project.
