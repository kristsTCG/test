# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: Responsible for validating user input data.
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Language: JavaScript

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Handles user authentication processes.
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Language: Python

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionalities in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Use `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing.
2. Implement the authentication logic provided in `auth.py` to authenticate users within the system.

Ensure to integrate these files appropriately within the project to enable secure user authentication processes.
