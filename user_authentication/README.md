# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**:
   - Language: JavaScript
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Role: This file is responsible for validating user input data for authentication purposes. It ensures that the data provided by the user meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Language: Python
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Role: This file contains the authentication logic for verifying user credentials and granting access to authorized users. It handles the authentication process securely and efficiently.

## Usage
1. To work with the validation functionality, refer to `validator.js`. You can customize the validation rules according to your project requirements by modifying this file.
   
2. For authentication tasks, utilize `auth.py`. This file contains the necessary logic to authenticate users based on their credentials. Make sure to integrate this file with other parts of the project that require user authentication.

3. Ensure that both files are properly imported and used in the relevant modules of your project to enable seamless user authentication functionality.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length and character requirements.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username allowing only alphanumeric characters and underscores within a specific length range.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character complexity.

**Usage:** This file can be imported in other JavaScript files using `require` or `import` statements, and the functions can be called directly with the appropriate input parameters.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by invalidating the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and not expired.

**Usage:** Import the `UserAuth` class from this file to handle user authentication in your Python application.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta` from `datetime`: For calculating expiration time for session tokens.
- `typing.Optional` and `typing.Dict`: For type hints in function signatures.
