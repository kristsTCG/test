# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring the integrity and security of user information.
   
2. `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication within the system.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionality provided in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Use the functions defined in `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing.
2. Implement the authentication logic defined in `auth.py` to manage user login, registration, and authentication processes.
3. Ensure to integrate these files into the broader project structure to enable seamless user authentication capabilities.
