# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user inputs and ensuring data integrity during the authentication process.
   
2. **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` with 2198 characters manages user authentication logic, including login, registration, and token generation.

## Usage
To utilize the code in this folder:
- Use `validator.js` for validating user inputs before processing authentication requests.
- Implement the functionalities provided in `auth.py` for user authentication, including login and registration processes.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length and character requirements.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username allowing only alphanumeric characters and underscores within a specific length range.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character complexity.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class in your code and call its static methods for input validation and password strength assessment.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session by invalidating the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in the provided code).
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
