# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes files for validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: Responsible for validating user input for authentication purposes.
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Language: JavaScript

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Manages user authentication processes such as login, registration, and password management.
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Language: Python

## Usage
1. **validator.js**
   - Ensure that the `validator.js` file is included in the appropriate modules where user input validation is required.
   - Use the functions provided in `validator.js` to validate user input for authentication forms.

2. **auth.py**
   - Import the `auth.py` module in the relevant parts of the project where user authentication functionalities are needed.
   - Utilize the functions defined in `auth.py` to handle user authentication tasks such as login, registration, and password management.

Ensure that the code in these files is integrated correctly with the rest of the project to maintain secure user authentication processes.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on various criteria.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Register a new user with a unique username.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticate a user and return a session token.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: End a user's session.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to manage user authentication operations. Call `register_user` to add a new user, `login` to authenticate a user and get a session token, `logout` to end a user's session, and `is_authenticated` to check if a session token is valid.

**Dependencies:** `hashlib`, `json`, `datetime`, `timedelta`, `typing`.
