## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` is organized with two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters, responsible for validating user input.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters, handling authentication processes.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This file is crucial for ensuring that user input meets the required criteria for authentication. It plays a key role in validating user data before proceeding with authentication processes.
- `auth.py`: This Python file is essential for managing user authentication within the project. It handles tasks such as user login, registration, and authentication verification.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review `validator.js` to understand the validation logic and criteria for user input.
2. Explore `auth.py` to familiarize yourself with the authentication processes and functions available.
3. Modify or extend the code as needed to customize user authentication functionalities for your project.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is 3-20 characters long, alphanumeric, and contains underscores only.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of the input password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use its validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py
