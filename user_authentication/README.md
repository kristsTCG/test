# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side input validation and auth.py for server-side authentication processes.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation logic to ensure that user input is correct before submission.
- **auth.py**: This Python file handles server-side authentication tasks such as verifying user credentials and generating tokens.

## Usage
1. Use `validator.js` to implement client-side validation by including it in your HTML file and calling its functions on form submission events.
2. Utilize `auth.py` for server-side authentication by importing it into your Python application and calling its functions to authenticate users and manage sessions.
