# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` for validation in JavaScript and `auth.py` for authentication in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication tasks within the project.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Import the `validator.js` file into your JavaScript project.
   - Utilize the validation functions provided to validate user input such as email addresses, passwords, etc.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Import the `auth.py` file into your Python project.
   - Use the authentication functions to manage user registration, login, and authentication processes within your application.
