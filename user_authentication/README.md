# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It is responsible for validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file is 2198 characters long and handles the authentication process. It manages user login, registration, and authentication tasks within the system.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Modify the `validator.js` file to customize the validation rules according to project requirements.
2. Use the functions defined in `auth.py` to implement user authentication features in your project.
3. Ensure that the integration of these files with other parts of the system is done correctly to maintain secure user authentication processes.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input is a valid email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and a number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is 3-20 characters long, alphanumeric, and contains underscores only.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class using `require` or `import` statements to access the validation functions.

**Dependencies:** No notable dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** To use this file, create an instance of `UserAuth` and call its methods for user registration, login, logout, and session validation.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For handling date and time.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
