# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` handles the authentication logic for users. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the system.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules applied to user input.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to understand the authentication logic and how user authentication is handled within the system.
3. Integrate these files into your project to enable user authentication features effectively.
