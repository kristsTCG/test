# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This functionality is crucial for managing user access and security.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication logic using different programming languages. Currently, it includes a JavaScript file (`validator.js`) and a Python file (`auth.py`).

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains logic for validating user input during the authentication process. It plays a key role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication on the server-side. It likely includes functions for user login, registration, and session management.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality, refer to `validator.js` and integrate its methods into your frontend authentication forms.
   
2. For server-side authentication tasks, interact with the functions defined in `auth.py` within your backend code. Ensure proper integration with your existing server logic for user authentication.

3. Maintain the integrity and security of user data by regularly updating and testing the authentication logic in these files.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is 3-20 characters long and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file and use its static methods for input validation and password strength assessment.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session by removing the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to use the provided authentication functionalities.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For handling JSON data.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
