# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user inputs and ensuring data integrity during the authentication process.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication logic, such as verifying user credentials and generating authentication tokens.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
1. Review the code in `validator.js` to understand the validation rules applied to user inputs.
2. Examine `auth.py` to understand how user authentication is implemented in the project.
3. Integrate these files into the project's authentication system as needed, ensuring proper error handling and security measures are in place.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of being at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and a number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is 3-20 characters long and consists of alphanumeric characters and underscores only.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of the input password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** This file can be imported using `require` or `import` statements in other JavaScript files to perform input validation tasks.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
