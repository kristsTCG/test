# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes a JavaScript file for validation and a Python file for handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. The key components include a validator script for input validation and an authentication module for user login and access control.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input data to ensure it meets the required criteria.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file, with 2198 characters, manages user authentication processes such as login, registration, and access control within the system.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication features in the project:
1. Use the `validator.js` file to validate user input data before processing it further.
2. Implement the functions provided in `auth.py` to handle user login, registration, and access control functionalities effectively.
