# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This file contains JavaScript code (1212 characters) responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the data provided by users meet the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file (2198 characters) manages the authentication process for users. It handles user login, registration, and authentication using secure methods.

## Usage
1. To utilize the functionalities provided by `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code and call its validation functions as needed.
   
2. For the authentication tasks, import `auth.py` into your Python project and utilize its functions for user registration, login, and authentication processes.

Ensure to follow the documentation within each file for specific usage instructions and parameters.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
