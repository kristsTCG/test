# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It includes validation logic in JavaScript and authentication logic in Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication processes. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` for input validation and `auth.py` for authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains logic for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication tasks within the application.

## Usage
To utilize the code in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the logic in `validator.js` to understand the input validation requirements.
2. Explore the functionalities in `auth.py` to manage user authentication processes.
3. Integrate these files into your project's authentication system as needed.
