# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate the validation logic implemented in JavaScript and the authentication logic implemented in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains the user validation logic, comprising 1212 characters of code. It is responsible for validating user input data.
- `auth.py`: This Python file contains the user authentication logic, comprising 2198 characters of code. It handles user authentication processes such as login, logout, and session management.

## Usage
1. To work with the user validation logic, refer to `validator.js`. This file contains functions for validating user input data such as email addresses, passwords, and other user information.
2. For user authentication processes, refer to `auth.py`. This file provides functions for user login, logout, and managing user sessions.
3. Ensure to integrate these files into the project's authentication system to enable secure user authentication and validation processes.

- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password and returns a descriptive level.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, logout, and session validation.
- `hash_password()`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user()`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
