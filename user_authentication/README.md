# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
- `auth.py`: This file handles the authentication logic using Python. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review `validator.js` to understand the validation rules applied to user input.
2. Explore `auth.py` to grasp the authentication flow and processes implemented in Python.
3. Modify the files as needed to customize authentication functionalities for the project.
4. Ensure that any changes made adhere to security best practices for user authentication.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets specific criteria (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username meets specific criteria (3-20 characters, alphanumeric and underscores only).
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** User authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticate a user and return a session token.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: End a user session based on the session token.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Check if a session token is valid and the user is authenticated.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to manage user authentication. Call `register_user` to add new users, `login` to authenticate users and get a session token, `logout` to end a user session, and `is_authenticated` to check if a session is valid.

**Dependencies:** `hashlib`, `json`, `datetime`, `timedelta`, `typing`.
