# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is written in Python and is responsible for handling the authentication logic. It manages user authentication processes such as login, logout, and session management.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules applied to user input.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to understand how user authentication is implemented in the project.
3. Make necessary modifications to the validation rules or authentication logic as per project requirements.
4. Ensure that any changes made adhere to security best practices for user authentication.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and a number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is 3-20 characters long and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of the input password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file and use its static methods to perform input validation.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session by removing the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and not expired.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints (not used in this file).
