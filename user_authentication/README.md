# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` for client-side input validation written in JavaScript, and `auth.py` for server-side authentication logic written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submission.
  
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is responsible for server-side authentication processes. It manages user authentication, login, and logout functionalities within the project.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review `validator.js` for client-side input validation rules and modify them as needed.
2. Understand the authentication logic implemented in `auth.py` for server-side authentication processes.
3. Ensure proper integration of these files with other components of the project that require user authentication functionality.
