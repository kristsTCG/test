# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side input validation and auth.py for server-side authentication logic.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation logic to ensure that user input meets specified criteria before submission.
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling server-side authentication processes, such as verifying user credentials and managing user sessions.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication features provided in this folder:
1. Modify `validator.js` to customize input validation rules as needed.
2. Implement the authentication logic in `auth.py` to suit the project's requirements.
3. Ensure that both client-side and server-side validation processes work seamlessly together for a secure user authentication experience.
