## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters of code and is responsible for validating user input data for authentication purposes.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file consists of 2198 characters and manages the authentication process for users, including login, registration, and session management.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the code in `validator.js` to understand the validation rules and functions.
2. Examine `auth.py` to grasp the authentication logic and methods implemented.
3. Integrate the necessary functions from these files into your project to enable user authentication features.
4. Ensure to handle errors and exceptions effectively to enhance the security and reliability of the authentication process.
