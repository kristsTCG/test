# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. It includes a JavaScript file for validation and a Python file for handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` for client-side validation and `auth.py` for server-side authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring data integrity and security on the frontend.
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication on the server-side. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed for different input fields.
   - Integrate the validation functions with your frontend forms to ensure data accuracy.
   
2. **auth.py**:
   - Configure the authentication settings such as token expiration and hashing algorithms.
   - Implement additional security measures like two-factor authentication if required.
   - Integrate the authentication endpoints with your backend APIs for user authentication.

Ensure to follow best practices for user authentication and security while working with the code in this folder.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username inputs, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets specific criteria (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username meets specific criteria (3-20 characters, alphanumeric and underscores only).
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of the input password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to access the validation functions.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token for active sessions.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session by removing the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
