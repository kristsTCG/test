# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized with two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters responsible for validating user input.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file is crucial for ensuring that user input meets the required criteria and is safe for processing within the system. It plays a vital role in maintaining data integrity and security.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is essential for managing user authentication within the project. It handles user login, registration, and authentication processes, ensuring secure access to the system.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review `validator.js` to understand the validation rules applied to user input.
2. Examine `auth.py` to understand how user authentication is implemented in the project.
3. Modify the code as needed to customize authentication processes or validation criteria.
4. Ensure that any changes made adhere to security best practices to protect user data.
