# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes scripts for validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: Handles input validation for user authentication.
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Language: JavaScript

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Manages user authentication processes.
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Language: Python

## Usage
1. **validator.js**
   - Ensure the necessary dependencies are installed.
   - Use the functions provided in `validator.js` to validate user input for authentication purposes.

2. **auth.py**
   - Make sure Python is installed on your system.
   - Utilize the functions and classes defined in `auth.py` to implement user authentication logic in your project.

Remember to handle errors and exceptions appropriately while working with these files to ensure secure user authentication processes.
