- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters, responsible for handling user authentication logic.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file is crucial for validating user input data to ensure it meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is essential for managing user authentication processes, including login, logout, and session management.

## Usage
