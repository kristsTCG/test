# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It includes functions for user login, registration, and authentication checks.

## Usage
Developers working on user authentication tasks can utilize the functions defined in `validator.js` for input validation. Additionally, they can leverage the authentication logic implemented in `auth.py` to manage user login and registration processes effectively. Ensure to follow the coding standards and guidelines established within these files for seamless integration with the project's authentication system.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class in your code:
```javascript
const InputValidator = require('./validator.js');
```
Then, you can call the validation functions like `InputValidator.validateEmail(email)` or `InputValidator.getPasswordStrength(password)`.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session management.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token for active sessions.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session by removing the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** This file can be imported into other Python scripts to handle user authentication tasks.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
