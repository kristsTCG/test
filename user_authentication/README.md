# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate the validation logic in JavaScript and the authentication logic in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains the logic for validating user inputs and ensuring data integrity. It plays a crucial role in preventing invalid data from being processed further.
   
2. `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication using secure methods.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality, refer to `validator.js` and integrate the validation logic into your user input forms.
   
2. For user authentication features, interact with `auth.py` to implement secure user login and registration processes within your project.
