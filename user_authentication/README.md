# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` for client-side input validation written in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication logic written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This file contains client-side validation logic to ensure that user input meets specified criteria before submission.
- `auth.py`: This file handles server-side authentication tasks such as verifying user credentials and managing user sessions.

## Usage
1. To utilize the client-side validation functionality, refer to the `validator.js` file and integrate the validation logic into your front-end code.
2. For server-side authentication tasks, utilize the functions and methods defined in the `auth.py` file to authenticate users and manage user sessions securely.

- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates a password based on length and character requirements.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates a username for length and character restrictions.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character complexity.

**Usage:** This file can be imported into other JavaScript files using `require` or `import` statements.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session management.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication processes.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib` for hashing functions.
- `json` for JSON serialization.
- `datetime` for handling date and time.
- `timedelta` for time-related calculations.
- `typing` for type hints.
