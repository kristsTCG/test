# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria.
- `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication within the system.

## Usage
Developers can utilize the `validator.js` file to implement input validation logic in the frontend, ensuring data integrity and security. The `auth.py` file can be used to integrate user authentication features in the backend, enabling secure user login and registration processes. Developers should refer to the specific functions and methods within these files to understand how to leverage them effectively in the project.
