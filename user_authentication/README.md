# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` contains two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters responsible for user input validation.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Role**: Responsible for validating user input data.
- **Character Count**: 1212
- **Usage**: Ensures that user-provided data meets specified criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.

### auth.py
- **Role**: Manages user authentication processes.
- **Character Count**: 2198
- **Usage**: Handles user login, registration, and authentication functionalities.

## Usage
1. To utilize the user input validation functionality:
   - Open `validator.js`.
   - Review the validation rules and criteria defined within the file.
   - Integrate the validation functions into the appropriate parts of the project where user input validation is required.

2. To work with user authentication processes:
   - Access `auth.py`.
   - Implement the authentication methods provided within the file for user login, registration, and authentication.
   - Ensure proper integration with other project components that require user authentication functionalities.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if a password meets complexity requirements.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength level of a password based on complexity criteria.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

```javascript
const InputValidator = require('./validator.js');

if (InputValidator.validateEmail(email)) {
    // Email is valid
}

if (InputValidator.validatePassword(password)) {
    // Password meets complexity requirements
}

const strengthLevel = InputValidator.getPasswordStrength(password);
console.log(`Password strength: ${strengthLevel}`);
```

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
