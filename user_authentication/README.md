## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder contains two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters, responsible for validating user input.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters, handling the authentication process.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Role**: Responsible for validating user input.
- **Character Count**: 1212
- **Usage**: Used to ensure that user-provided data meets specified criteria before processing.

### auth.py
- **Role**: Handles the authentication process.
- **Character Count**: 2198
- **Usage**: Implements the logic for user authentication, including login and registration processes.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality, refer to `validator.js`. Modify or extend the validation rules as needed for your project.
2. For user authentication features, interact with `auth.py`. Implement the necessary authentication flows and integrate them into your application.

Ensure to follow best practices and security measures when working with user authentication functionality.
