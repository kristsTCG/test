# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized with two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python. These files handle user input validation and authentication logic respectively.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
   
2. `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication logic. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the system.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
- Review `validator.js` for input validation functions and ensure they are integrated into the user input validation process.
- Utilize `auth.py` for user authentication functionalities such as login, registration, and authentication processes.
- Ensure that any modifications or additions to the authentication system are properly implemented and tested within these files.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file contains input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets complexity requirements.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username meets length and character requirements.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of the input password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class where input validation is needed and call the respective validation functions or password strength function.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password()`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user()`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login()`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout()`: Method to end a user session by providing the session token.
- `is_authenticated()`: Method to check if a session token is valid and the user is authenticated.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization/deserialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `typing`: For type hints in function signatures.
