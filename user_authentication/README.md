# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes a JavaScript file for validation (`validator.js`) and a Python file for authentication (`auth.py`).

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
- `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication tasks within the project.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions, refer to `validator.js` and incorporate the necessary validation checks in your code.
2. For user authentication tasks such as login and registration, interact with the functions defined in `auth.py` to authenticate users securely within the project.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** This file can be imported as a module in other JavaScript files to perform input validation for user authentication.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, logout, and session validation.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and hashed password.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and generates a session token for valid credentials.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the provided session token.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid and not expired.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating expiration time for session tokens.
- `typing.Optional`: For defining optional return types.
- `typing.Dict`: For defining dictionary types.
