# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This module is responsible for validating user input and handling user authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` consists of two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters that handles input validation for user authentication.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters that manages user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file is crucial for ensuring that user input for authentication is valid and secure. It contains functions for validating input fields such as email, password, and username.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is essential for managing user authentication within the project. It handles processes such as user login, registration, and authentication token generation.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review `validator.js` to understand the input validation logic and make any necessary modifications to suit the project requirements.
2. Explore `auth.py` to familiarize yourself with the user authentication processes implemented in the project.
3. Integrate the functions from these files into your project's authentication flow as needed.
