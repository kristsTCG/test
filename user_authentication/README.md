# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for authentication processes.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input data to ensure it meets specified criteria. It plays a crucial role in maintaining data integrity and security.
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file handles user authentication processes such as login, logout, and user session management. It is responsible for verifying user credentials and granting access to authorized users.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Import the `validator.js` file into your JavaScript code.
   - Utilize the provided validation functions to validate user input data before processing it further.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Import the `auth.py` file into your Python code.
   - Use the authentication functions to implement user login, logout, and session management functionalities in your application.

Ensure to follow the documentation within each file for specific usage instructions and function details.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file contains input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username inputs, as well as determining the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username, allowing alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session by removing the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is still valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations like registration, login, logout, and session validation.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in the provided code snippet).
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating expiration time for session tokens.
- `typing`: For type hints in function signatures.
