# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. It includes scripts for validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python script `auth.py` is responsible for managing user authentication processes. It handles tasks such as user login, registration, and authentication verification.

## Usage
To utilize the functionality provided in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation logic and customize it as needed for your project.
2. Explore the `auth.py` script to familiarize yourself with the user authentication processes implemented in Python.
3. Integrate these scripts into your project to enable secure user authentication functionality.
