# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for authentication logic.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input to ensure data integrity and security. It plays a crucial role in preventing malicious inputs and maintaining data quality.
  
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication mechanisms to secure user access to the system.

## Usage
To utilize the functionality provided in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file for input validation requirements and integrate the necessary functions into your user input forms.
2. Utilize the `auth.py` file to implement user authentication features such as login, registration, and password management in your application.
3. Ensure to customize the authentication logic as per your project's specific requirements and security standards.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file contains input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email follows a standard email format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and a number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is 3-20 characters long and consists of alphanumeric characters and underscores only.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of the input password based on length and character types, returning a descriptive strength level.

**Usage:** To use this file, import it into your project where input validation for user authentication is needed. For example:
```javascript
const InputValidator = require('./validator.js');

if (InputValidator.validateEmail('example@email.com')) {
    console.log('Email is valid');
}

if (InputValidator.validatePassword('StrongPass123')) {
    console.log('Password is valid');
}

if (InputValidator.validateUsername('user_name123')) {
    console.log('Username is valid');
}

const passwordStrength = InputValidator.getPasswordStrength('SecurePass123');
console.log('Password strength:', passwordStrength);
```

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token for active sessions.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by removing the session token from active sessions.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication processes.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For handling JSON data.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
