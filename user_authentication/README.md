# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate the validation logic in `validator.js` (JavaScript) and the authentication logic in `auth.py` (Python).

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This file contains the JavaScript code for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
- `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication using various methods.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality, refer to `validator.js`. This file contains functions for validating user input such as email addresses, passwords, and other required fields.
2. For user authentication tasks, interact with `auth.py`. This file provides methods for user login, registration, and authentication processes. Ensure to follow the defined authentication flow within this file for secure user access.
