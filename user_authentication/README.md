## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` consists of two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters, responsible for validating user input data.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters, handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Role**: Validates user input data.
- **Character Count**: 1212

### auth.py
- **Role**: Manages user authentication processes.
- **Character Count**: 2198

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided by the `user_authentication` module:
1. Use the `validator.js` file to validate user input data by importing and calling the necessary functions.
2. Utilize the `auth.py` file to manage user authentication processes such as login, registration, and password reset functionalities.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file contains input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username inputs, as well as determining the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates an email address based on a regular expression pattern.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates a password based on specific criteria (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates a username based on length and character restrictions.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character complexity.

**Usage:** This file can be imported as a module using `require` or `import` statements, and then the functions can be called directly with the appropriate input values.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user authentication operations.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by invalidating the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations. Call `register_user` to add a new user, `login` to authenticate a user and get a session token, `logout` to end a user session, and `is_authenticated` to check if a session token is valid.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints (not used in this file).
