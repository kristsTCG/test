# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This file contains JavaScript code for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
   
2. `auth.py`: The `auth.py` file is written in Python and is responsible for handling user authentication logic. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the application.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
- Review `validator.js` to understand the validation rules applied to user input.
- Explore `auth.py` to understand how user authentication processes are handled in the project.
- Make necessary modifications or enhancements to the authentication logic as per project requirements.
