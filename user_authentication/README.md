## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input data to ensure it meets specified criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file consists of 2198 characters and manages the authentication logic for users, including login, registration, and session management.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality, refer to the `validator.js` file and incorporate its methods into your user input validation process.
   
2. For user authentication tasks, such as login and registration, utilize the functions and classes defined in the `auth.py` file. Ensure to follow the authentication flow as per the logic implemented in this file.
