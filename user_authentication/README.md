# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This module is responsible for validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate the validation logic in `validator.js` (JavaScript) and the authentication logic in `auth.py` (Python). This separation helps maintain code clarity and modularity.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This file contains the JavaScript code for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that the data entered by users meets the required criteria for authentication.
- `auth.py`: The `auth.py` file contains Python code for handling user authentication processes. It includes functions for user login, registration, and authentication checks.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality, refer to the `validator.js` file and incorporate the validation methods into your user input forms.
2. For authentication processes, import and use the functions defined in `auth.py`. These functions can be integrated into your application's backend to manage user authentication securely.

Ensure to follow the coding standards and guidelines set within the project when working with the code in this folder.

- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character requirements.

**Usage:** This file can be imported as a module in other JavaScript files to perform input validation for user authentication.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
