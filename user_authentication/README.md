# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` for client-side input validation in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication logic in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic written in JavaScript. It ensures that user input meets specified criteria before submitting to the server for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file houses the server-side authentication logic written in Python. It handles user authentication requests, verifies user credentials, and manages user sessions securely.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**: To use the client-side validation logic, include `validator.js` in your HTML file using a script tag. You can then call the validation functions provided in this file to validate user input before submitting a form.

2. **auth.py**: To utilize the server-side authentication logic, ensure that `auth.py` is integrated into your server-side codebase. You can import functions from this file to authenticate users, manage sessions, and enforce security measures for user authentication.

Ensure that both client-side and server-side components work seamlessly together to provide a secure and reliable user authentication system.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username inputs, as well as determining the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character requirements.

**Usage:** To use this file, import it into your project using `require` or `import` statements. Then, call the desired validation functions with the input data to perform the validation.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token for active sessions.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by removing the session token from active sessions.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to access user authentication functionalities like registration, login, logout, and session validation.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For handling JSON data.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
