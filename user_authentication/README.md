# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submission.
  
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is responsible for server-side authentication processes. It manages user authentication, login, and logout functionalities using Python.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication features provided in this folder:
1. Use `validator.js` for client-side validation by including it in your HTML files and calling its functions as needed.
2. Integrate `auth.py` into your server-side codebase to handle user authentication processes. Ensure to import and utilize the necessary functions for user login and logout functionalities.
