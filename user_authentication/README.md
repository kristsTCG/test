# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder consists of two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python. These files handle the validation of user input and the authentication logic respectively.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input such as email addresses, passwords, and other form data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring data integrity and security.
   
2. `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes such as login, logout, and session management. It interacts with the database to verify user credentials and maintain user sessions.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Utilize the functions in `validator.js` to validate user input before processing.
2. Implement the authentication logic provided in `auth.py` to manage user authentication within the project.
3. Ensure to integrate these files with other components of the project that require user authentication functionalities.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on various criteria.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class where input validation is needed:
```javascript
const InputValidator = require('./validator.js');

if (InputValidator.validateEmail('example@email.com')) {
    // Email is valid
}

if (InputValidator.validatePassword('StrongPassword123')) {
    // Password meets criteria
}

console.log(InputValidator.getPasswordStrength('SecurePass123')); // Output: 'Strong'
```

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
