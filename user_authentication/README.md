# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It includes scripts for validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. The key components include a JavaScript file for validation (`validator.js`) and a Python file for authentication (`auth.py`).

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input, ensuring data integrity before processing it further.
- **auth.py**: The Python script `auth.py` manages user authentication processes, such as login, registration, and user session management.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Use the functions in `validator.js` to validate user input before processing it.
   - Import the necessary functions into your code to ensure data integrity.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Utilize the functions in `auth.py` for user authentication tasks like login, registration, and session management.
   - Integrate the authentication logic into your application to secure user access.

Ensure to follow best practices while incorporating these scripts into your project to enhance user authentication and data validation processes.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username inputs, as well as determining the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username, allowing only alphanumeric characters and underscores within a specific length range.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types, returning a descriptive level.

**Usage:** This file can be imported as a module to access the InputValidator class and its validation methods.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies are required for this file.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class managing user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token for active sessions.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by removing the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** This file can be imported into other Python scripts to handle user authentication processes.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: for hashing passwords.
- `json`: for handling JSON data.
- `datetime`: for working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: for calculating time differences.
- `typing`: for type hints.
