# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This module is responsible for validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate the validation logic in `validator.js` written in JavaScript and the authentication functionality in `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This file contains the validation logic for user inputs. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
- `auth.py`: The `auth.py` file handles the authentication process for users. It manages user login, registration, and authentication using Python.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation logic, refer to the `validator.js` file. Modify or extend the validation rules as needed to suit the project's requirements.
2. For user authentication functionalities, interact with the `auth.py` file. Implement user registration, login, and authentication processes using the provided functions and methods.

Ensure that both files are integrated into the project's authentication flow to maintain secure user interactions.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username, allowing alphanumeric characters and underscores within a specific length range.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types, returning a descriptive level.

**Usage:** This file can be imported as a module in other JavaScript files to perform input validation tasks for user authentication.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by invalidating the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and the user is authenticated.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations. Call methods like `register_user`, `login`, `logout`, and `is_authenticated` as needed.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: Used for hashing passwords.
- `json`: Not used in this file but imported.
- `datetime`: Used for managing timestamps and session expiration.
- `timedelta`: Used for calculating session expiration time.
- `typing`: Used for type hints.
