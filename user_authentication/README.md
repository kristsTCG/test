## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes the following key components:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file containing functions for validating user input data.
- `auth.py`: A Python file responsible for user authentication logic and processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file contains functions for validating user input data to ensure it meets specified criteria. It plays a crucial role in maintaining data integrity and security within the authentication process.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is essential for handling user authentication tasks such as login, registration, and password management. It implements the core logic for authenticating users and managing their access to the system.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Use the functions defined in `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing it further.
2. Utilize the functionalities provided in `auth.py` for user authentication processes such as login, registration, and password management.
3. Ensure to follow the defined authentication workflows and security measures implemented in these files to maintain a secure user authentication system.
