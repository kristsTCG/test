# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for authentication logic.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
   
2. **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is responsible for handling user authentication logic. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the application.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the input validation functions available.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to grasp the authentication logic implemented in the project.
3. Integrate these files into your application to enhance user authentication processes.
