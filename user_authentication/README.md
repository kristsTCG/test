# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This file contains validation functions for user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user data meets the required criteria before authentication.
- `auth.py`: This Python file handles the authentication process for users. It manages user login, registration, and other authentication-related tasks.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file for validation functions and customize them as needed.
2. Use the `auth.py` file to handle user authentication tasks within the project.
3. Ensure that the functions in both files are integrated correctly with other parts of the project that require user authentication.
