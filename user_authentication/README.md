## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It helps ensure that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submission.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python file handles server-side authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication using secure methods.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**: Modify the validation rules in this file to customize the validation criteria for user input on the client side.
   
2. **auth.py**: Use the functions provided in this file to implement user authentication features on the server side. Ensure to handle user registration, login, and authentication securely.

Ensure to maintain the integrity and security of user authentication processes by following best practices and keeping the code up to date with any security standards.

- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and the presence of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file and use its static methods to validate user input.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py
