# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This functionality is crucial for managing user access and security.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side validation in JavaScript and auth.py for server-side authentication in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic for user inputs. It ensures that user-provided data meets specified criteria before submission.
- **auth.py**: The auth.py file is responsible for server-side authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication using Python.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to match the project requirements.
   - Include the validator.js file in your HTML pages using `<script src="path/to/validator.js"></script>`.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Implement additional authentication logic as required by the project.
   - Integrate the auth.py file with your backend system to handle user authentication processes.

Ensure that both client-side and server-side authentication mechanisms work seamlessly together to provide a secure user authentication experience.
