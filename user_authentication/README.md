# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file contains 2198 characters and handles the authentication logic. It verifies user credentials and grants access based on the authentication process.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionalities in this folder:
1. Modify the `validator.js` file to customize the validation rules according to project requirements.
2. Implement the authentication logic in the `auth.py` file to authenticate users securely.
3. Ensure proper integration of these files with other parts of the project that require user authentication.
