# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input data related to authentication processes.
- **auth.py**: This Python file, 2198 characters long, manages the authentication logic for users within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionality in this folder, developers can refer to the `validator.js` file for handling input validation and the `auth.py` file for managing user authentication processes. Ensure to follow the code structure and logic implemented in these files for seamless integration with the project's authentication system.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is 3-20 characters long and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of the input password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticate a user and return a session token.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: End a user session based on the session token.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Check if a session token is valid and the user is authenticated.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing.Optional`, `typing.Dict`: For type hints.
