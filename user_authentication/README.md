# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submission.
  
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file contains server-side authentication logic written in Python. It manages user authentication processes such as login, registration, and session handling.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to suit the project's requirements.
   - Include the `validator.js` file in your HTML templates using a script tag.
   - Call the validation functions on user input fields to enforce validation rules.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Integrate the authentication logic into your server-side application.
   - Use the functions provided in `auth.py` for user registration, login, and session management.
   - Ensure proper error handling and security measures are in place to protect user data.

By following the guidelines above, you can effectively utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in the `user_authentication` folder.
