# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized with two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file containing functions for validating user input.
- `auth.py`: A Python file implementing authentication logic.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This file plays a crucial role in ensuring that user input is validated before processing. It contains functions for validating various types of user data, such as email addresses, passwords, and usernames.
- `auth.py`: This file is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It includes functions for user login, registration, and password management.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the necessary functions into your JavaScript files and call them as needed to validate user input.
2. For user authentication functionalities, import `auth.py` into your Python scripts or modules. Use the provided functions to manage user login, registration, and password-related tasks within your application.
