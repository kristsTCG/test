# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python file handles the authentication logic for users. It includes functions for user login, registration, and authentication processes.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation functions as needed to adjust the criteria for user input validation.
   - Import and use the validation functions in other parts of the project where user input validation is required.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Use the functions provided in this file to implement user authentication features in the project.
   - Customize the authentication logic to suit the specific requirements of the project.
   - Ensure to handle user registration, login, and authentication securely to protect user data.

By following the guidelines provided in the key files, developers can effectively implement user authentication features in the project using the code in the `user_authentication` folder.
