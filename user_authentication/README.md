   - Language: JavaScript

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Manages user authentication processes.
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Language: Python

## Usage
1. **validator.js**
   - To use the validator script, import it into your JavaScript file using `require('./validator.js')`.
   - Call the appropriate validation functions provided in the script to validate user inputs.

2. **auth.py**
   - Import the `auth` module into your Python script using `import auth`.
   - Utilize the functions in `auth.py` to handle user authentication tasks such as login, logout, and user session management.
