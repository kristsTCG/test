# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This module is responsible for validating user input and handling user authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` contains two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters, responsible for validating user input data.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters, responsible for handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file contains functions for validating user input data to ensure it meets the required criteria before processing.

### auth.py
This file handles user authentication processes, such as user login, registration, and password management.

## Usage
1. To use the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the necessary functions into your JavaScript files and call them to validate user input data.
   
   Example:
   ```javascript
   import { validateUsername, validatePassword } from './validator.js';

   const username = 'example_user';
   const password = 'secure_password';

   if (validateUsername(username) && validatePassword(password)) {
       // Proceed with processing user input
   } else {
       // Display error messages to the user
   }
   ```

2. To utilize the user authentication functionalities in `auth.py`, import the necessary functions into your Python files and call them as needed.

   Example:
   ```python
   from auth import login, register, change_password

   username = 'example_user'
   password = 'secure_password'

   if login(username, password):
       # User authentication successful
   else:
       # User authentication failed
   ```

**Purpose:** This file contains input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username inputs, as well as determining the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numeric characters.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username, allowing only alphanumeric characters and underscores within a specific length range.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class into your code. For example:
```javascript
const InputValidator = require('./validator.js');
```

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies are required for this file.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
