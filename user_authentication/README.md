The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It includes scripts for validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: Responsible for validating user input data.
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Language: JavaScript

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Manages user authentication processes.
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Language: Python

## Usage
1. **validator.js**
   - To use the `validator.js` script, import it into your JavaScript file using `require` or `import`.
   - Utilize the functions provided in `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing.

2. **auth.py**
   - Incorporate the `auth.py` script into your Python project by importing it.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username inputs, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the specified criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username meets the specified criteria.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of the input password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class from `validator.js` in your code.

```javascript
const InputValidator = require('./validator.js');

// Example usage
if (InputValidator.validateEmail('example@email.com')) {
    console.log('Email is valid');
}

console.log(InputValidator.getPasswordStrength('StrongPassword123'));
```

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the authentication system. Call methods like `register_user`, `login`, `logout`, and `is_authenticated` as needed.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: for hashing functions.
- `json`: for JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: for working with dates and times.
- `typing`: for type hints.
