   - Language: JavaScript

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Manages authentication processes such as user login and verification.
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Language: Python

## Usage
1. **validator.js**
   - To use the `validator.js` file, ensure it is imported into the relevant JavaScript file where user input validation is required.
   - Utilize the validation functions provided within `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing.

2. **auth.py**
   - Import `auth.py` into your Python script or application where user authentication is needed.
   - Use the functions and methods defined in `auth.py` to handle user login, verification, and authentication processes.
