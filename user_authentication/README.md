# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` consists of two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters responsible for user input validation.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters handling user authentication logic.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Role**: Handles user input validation.
- **Character Count**: 1212
- **Usage**: Ensures that user input meets specified criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.

### auth.py
- **Role**: Manages user authentication processes.
- **Character Count**: 2198
- **Usage**: Implements authentication logic, such as verifying user credentials and granting access.

## Usage
1. To utilize the user input validation functionality, refer to `validator.js`. Modify validation criteria as needed to suit project requirements.
2. For user authentication processes, interact with `auth.py`. Implement additional authentication logic or integrate with existing systems as necessary.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength evaluation.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and a number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is 3-20 characters long and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Evaluates the strength of a password based on length and character complexity.

**Usage:** This file can be imported as a module to perform input validation in user authentication processes.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the session token.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to use the provided authentication functionalities.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: For handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing.Optional`: For type hinting the return value of functions.
