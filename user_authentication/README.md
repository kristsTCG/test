# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is structured to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file contains authentication logic written in Python. It manages user authentication processes such as login, logout, and session management.

## Usage
1. To use the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the necessary functions into your JavaScript files and call them as needed to validate user input data.

2. Utilize the functionalities provided in `auth.py` for user authentication tasks in your Python application. Import the necessary functions and integrate them into your authentication workflow.

3. Ensure to follow the documentation and comments within the files for a better understanding of the functions and their parameters.
