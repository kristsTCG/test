# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` for client-side input validation written in JavaScript, and `auth.py` for server-side authentication logic written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submission.
   
2. `auth.py`: The `auth.py` file is responsible for server-side authentication processes. It manages user authentication, login, and authorization within the application.

## Usage
To utilize the functionality provided in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Incorporate the `validator.js` file in your front-end code to validate user input before submitting forms.
2. Integrate the `auth.py` file into your server-side code to handle user authentication and authorization processes effectively.
