# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling the authentication process. It includes functions for user login, registration, and authentication checks.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
1. Modify the `validator.js` file to customize the validation rules according to project requirements.
2. Use the functions defined in `auth.py` to implement user authentication features in the project.
3. Ensure to integrate these files with other parts of the project that require user authentication mechanisms.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the provided validation methods.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the session token.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid and the user is authenticated.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to manage user authentication operations. Call `register_user` to add a new user, `login` to authenticate and get a session token, `logout` to end a session, and `is_authenticated` to check session validity.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
