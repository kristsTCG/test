# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate the validation logic in `validator.js` written in JavaScript and the authentication logic in `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains the validation logic for user input. It ensures that the data entered by the user meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: This file handles the authentication process for users. It verifies user credentials and grants access to authorized users.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to suit the project's requirements.
   - Include `validator.js` in the appropriate modules where user input validation is required.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Implement additional authentication methods or integrate with external authentication services.
   - Use the functions provided in `auth.py` to authenticate users within the project.

Ensure to maintain the integrity of the authentication process and update the validation rules as necessary to enhance security.
