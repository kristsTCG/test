## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication features efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` and `auth.py`.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data, ensuring that it meets specified criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
- `auth.py`: This Python file manages user authentication logic, including login, registration, and token generation.

## Usage
Developers can utilize the `validator.js` functions to validate user input data before authentication. The `auth.py` file provides essential authentication functionalities that can be integrated into the project's user management system. Ensure to follow the documentation within each file for proper implementation and usage.
