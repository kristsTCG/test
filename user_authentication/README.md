# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication tasks within the project.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions provided in `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code and call the necessary functions to validate user input data.
   
2. For user authentication tasks, import `auth.py` into your Python code. Use the functions within this file to manage user login, registration, and authentication processes in your project.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class managing user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the session token.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: Used for hashing passwords.
- `json`: Not used in this file but imported.
- `datetime`: Used for date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: Used for calculating expiration time for sessions.
- `typing.Optional`: Used for type hinting.
