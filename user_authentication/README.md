# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It is responsible for validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side input validation and auth.py for server-side authentication logic.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation functions to ensure that user input meets specified criteria before submitting it for authentication.
- **auth.py**: The Python file auth.py handles server-side authentication processes, such as verifying user credentials and generating access tokens.

## Usage
1. To utilize the client-side validation functionality, refer to the functions defined in `validator.js` and integrate them into your front-end code where user input validation is required.
2. For server-side authentication tasks, import and use the functions provided in `auth.py` within your backend code to authenticate users and manage access control.
