# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains code for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication tasks within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided by the `user_authentication` folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the code in `validator.js` to understand the validation logic and criteria.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to grasp the user authentication processes implemented in Python.
3. Integrate the functions and methods from these files into your project as needed for user authentication purposes.
