# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication features. It includes validator.js for client-side validation in JavaScript and auth.py for server-side authentication in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation logic for user inputs. It ensures that user-provided data meets specified criteria before submission.
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for server-side authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication against the backend system.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify validation rules as needed by updating the logic in this file.
   - Include `validator.js` in your HTML files to enable client-side validation for user inputs.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Implement additional authentication features by extending the functionality in `auth.py`.
   - Integrate `auth.py` with your backend system to handle user authentication processes.

Ensure that both files work together seamlessly to provide a secure and user-friendly authentication experience for your application.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticate a user and return a session token.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: End a user session based on the provided session token.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Check if a session token is valid and the user is authenticated.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations like registration, login, and session handling.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing.Optional`: For type hinting optional return values.
- `typing.Dict`: For type hinting dictionary structures.
