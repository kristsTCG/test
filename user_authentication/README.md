## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized with two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file containing functions for validating user input.
- `auth.py`: A Python file responsible for user authentication logic.

## Key Files
### validator.js

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file manages user authentication processes, such as login, logout, and session management.

## Usage
1. To use the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the file and call the necessary functions to validate user input.
2. Utilize the functionalities provided in `auth.py` for user authentication processes. Import the file and use the defined functions for user login, logout, and session management.
