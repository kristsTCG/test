# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side validation and auth.py for server-side authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation logic for user inputs. It ensures that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submission.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for server-side authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication against the system.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to match the project requirements.
   - Include the `validator.js` file in your HTML templates to enable client-side validation.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Implement additional authentication logic as required by the project.
   - Integrate the authentication functions provided in `auth.py` with your backend system for user management.

Ensure that both client-side and server-side authentication processes are synchronized to provide a secure and seamless user experience.
