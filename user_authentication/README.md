# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes validation logic in JavaScript and authentication logic in Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks. It contains two key files: `validator.js` for input validation and `auth.py` for authentication processes.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters of code responsible for validating user inputs. It ensures that the data entered by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.

2. **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file, written in Python and consisting of 2198 characters, handles user authentication tasks. It includes functions for user login, registration, and session management.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities in this folder:
- Modify the validation criteria in `validator.js` to suit the project's requirements.
- Use the functions provided in `auth.py` for user authentication tasks such as login, registration, and session handling.
- Ensure to integrate these files with other parts of the project that require user authentication.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username inputs, as well as determining the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates a password based on specific criteria (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates a username for length (3-20 characters) and allowed characters (alphanumeric and underscores only).
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types, returning a strength level.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by invalidating the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations like registration, login, logout, and session validation.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For handling JSON data.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
