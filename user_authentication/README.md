# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. It handles tasks such as validating user input and managing user authentication.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate the validation logic in `validator.js` (JavaScript) and the authentication logic in `auth.py` (Python).

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains the validation logic for user input. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file contains the authentication logic for users. It manages user authentication processes, such as verifying credentials and generating access tokens.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules in `validator.js` to suit the project's requirements.
   - Import and use the validation functions in other parts of the project where user input needs to be validated.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Implement additional authentication methods or enhance existing ones in `auth.py`.
   - Integrate the authentication logic into the project's user management system.

Ensure that you understand the existing code structure and functionality before making any modifications.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username inputs, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character requirements.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class in your code and call the desired validation methods on user inputs.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session by invalidating the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and the user is authenticated.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For handling JSON data.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
