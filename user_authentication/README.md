# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input related to authentication processes. It ensures that user-provided data meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file, spanning 2198 characters, handles the actual authentication logic for users. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the system.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules for user input.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to understand the authentication logic and processes implemented.
3. Make necessary modifications or enhancements to the validation and authentication processes as per project requirements.
4. Ensure that any changes made adhere to the existing structure and conventions within the `user_authentication` folder.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is 3-20 characters long and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength level of a password based on its length and character types.

**Usage:** This file can be imported into other JavaScript files using `require` or `import` statements to access the input validation functionalities.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password, returning a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session using their session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and the user is authenticated.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations like registration, login, and session handling.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints (not used in this file).
