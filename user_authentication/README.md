# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for authentication processes.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
- `auth.py`: This file handles user authentication logic using Python. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the system.

## Usage
1. To utilize the input validation functionalities, refer to the `validator.js` file and incorporate the validation functions into your user input handling processes.
2. For user authentication tasks, utilize the `auth.py` file by importing the necessary functions and integrating them into your authentication workflows. Ensure to follow the authentication logic implemented in this file for secure user authentication within the system.
