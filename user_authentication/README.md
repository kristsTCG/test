# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- Role: Responsible for validating user input data.
- Size: 1212 characters
- Language: JavaScript

### auth.py
- Role: Handles authentication logic for user login and access control.
- Size: 2198 characters
- Language: Python

## Usage
1. To use the validation functionality, refer to `validator.js`. This file contains functions for validating user input data such as email addresses, passwords, etc.
2. For user authentication tasks, utilize `auth.py`. This file provides functions for user login, authentication, and access control mechanisms.

Ensure to integrate these files into the project's authentication flow as needed, following best practices for user security and data validation.
