# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input data for authentication purposes.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file contains 2198 characters and manages the authentication logic for users within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionalities in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file for user input validation logic.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to understand the authentication process for users.
3. Make necessary modifications or integrations based on project requirements.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character requirements.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class in your code and call the validation functions as needed.

```javascript
const InputValidator = require('./validator.js');

if (InputValidator.validateEmail('example@email.com')) {
    console.log('Email is valid');
}

if (InputValidator.validatePassword('StrongPassword123')) {
    console.log('Password meets criteria');
}

console.log(InputValidator.getPasswordStrength('GoodPassword123'));
```

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class managing user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to use the authentication functionalities provided by the class.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: for hashing functions.
- `json`: for JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: for working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: for calculating time differences.
- `typing.Optional`: for type hinting.
