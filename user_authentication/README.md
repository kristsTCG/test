   - Language: JavaScript

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Manages the authentication process for users.
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Language: Python

## Usage
1. **validator.js**
   - Ensure the `validator.js` file is included in your project.
   - Use the functions provided in `validator.js` to validate user input for authentication forms.

2. **auth.py**
   - Import `auth.py` into your project where user authentication is needed.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length and character requirements.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username allowing only alphanumeric characters and underscores within a specific length range.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and the presence of lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters.

**Usage:** This file can be imported into other JavaScript files using `require` or `import` statements to perform input validation for user authentication.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class managing user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For representing a duration of time.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
