# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder consists of two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python. These files are responsible for validating user input and managing user authentication, respectively.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for managing user authentication processes. It handles user login, registration, and authentication logic within the system.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
- Review `validator.js` to understand the validation rules and functions used for user input data.
- Explore `auth.py` to understand how user authentication processes are implemented in the project.
- Use the functions and logic provided in these files to integrate user authentication features into the project.

- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on various criteria.

**Usage:** This file can be imported using `require` or `import` statements in Node.js or other JavaScript environments to perform input validation for user authentication.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class managing user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session based on the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize user authentication functionalities.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For handling JSON data.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
