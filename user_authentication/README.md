# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the user data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.

2. `auth.py`: This Python file consists of 2198 characters and handles the authentication logic for users. It verifies user credentials and manages user sessions securely.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules applied to user input data.
2. Examine the `auth.py` file to grasp the authentication process and how user credentials are verified.
3. Integrate the authentication functionalities into your project by importing and using the necessary functions from these files.
