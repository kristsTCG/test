- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters, responsible for handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Role**: Validates user input data.
- **Character Count**: 1212
- **Language**: JavaScript

### auth.py
- **Role**: Handles user authentication processes.
- **Character Count**: 2198
- **Language**: Python

## Usage
