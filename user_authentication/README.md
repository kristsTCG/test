# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate the validation logic in JavaScript and the authentication logic in Python. The `validator.js` file contains code for validating user input, while the `auth.py` file handles user authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file (1212 characters) is responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python file (2198 characters) manages user authentication processes. It includes functions for verifying user credentials and granting access to authorized users.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to suit the project's requirements.
   - Include the `validator.js` file in the relevant parts of the project where user input validation is required.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Configure the authentication logic based on the project's authentication requirements.
   - Integrate the functions from `auth.py` into the project's user authentication flow.

Ensure that both files are appropriately imported and utilized within the project to maintain secure user authentication processes.

- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username allowing alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class in your code and call the desired validation methods.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password()`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user()`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login()`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password, returning a session token.
- `logout()`: Method to end a user session based on the session token.
- `is_authenticated()`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** This file can be imported into other Python scripts to handle user authentication tasks.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `typing`: For type hints.
