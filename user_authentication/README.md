# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input data related to authentication processes. It ensures that user-provided data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file is 2198 characters long and handles the authentication logic for users. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the application.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
- Review `validator.js` to understand the validation rules and criteria for user input data.
- Explore `auth.py` to understand the authentication logic implemented for user registration and login processes.
- Make necessary modifications or enhancements to the validation and authentication processes as per project requirements.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username inputs, as well as determining the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username allowing alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to access the validation methods.

```javascript
const InputValidator = require('./validator.js');

if (InputValidator.validateEmail('example@email.com')) {
    console.log('Email is valid');
}

const passwordStrength = InputValidator.getPasswordStrength('StrongPassword123');
console.log(`Password strength: ${passwordStrength}`);
```

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session based on the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to access user authentication functionalities.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib` for hashing passwords.
- `json` for JSON serialization.
- `datetime` for handling dates and times.
- `timedelta` for calculating time differences.
- `typing` for type hints.
