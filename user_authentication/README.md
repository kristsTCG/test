# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user data meets the required criteria before authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication logic. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the system.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionality provided in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Use the functions defined in `validator.js` to validate user input before processing authentication requests.
2. Implement the authentication logic defined in `auth.py` to manage user login, registration, and authentication processes.
3. Ensure that both files are integrated correctly within the project to enable seamless user authentication functionality.
