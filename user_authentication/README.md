# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It is responsible for validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: Responsible for validating user input data.
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Language: JavaScript

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Handles authentication processes such as user login and registration.
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Language: Python

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - To use the validator, import it into your JavaScript file:
     ```javascript
     import validator from './validator.js';
     ```
   - Utilize the validator functions to validate user input data.

2. **auth.py**:
   - To use the authentication functionalities, import the `auth` module in your Python code:
     ```python
     from auth import authenticate_user, register_user
     ```
   - Call the appropriate functions like `authenticate_user` or `register_user` to handle user authentication tasks.

Ensure that you follow the specific usage instructions within each file to effectively implement user authentication features in your project.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** User authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the session token.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
