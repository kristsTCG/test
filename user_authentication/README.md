# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Type: JavaScript
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Role: Responsible for validating user input and ensuring data integrity during the authentication process.

2. **auth.py**
   - Type: Python
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Role: Manages user authentication, including login, registration, and session handling using Python.

## Usage
1. To utilize the user validation functionality, refer to `validator.js`. This file contains functions to validate user input data before proceeding with authentication processes.

2. For user authentication tasks such as login, registration, and session management, `auth.py` is the main file to work with. It provides the necessary functions and logic to handle user authentication securely.

3. Ensure to follow the coding standards and guidelines set within the project when making modifications or additions to the user authentication functionalities in this folder.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file contains input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and a number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is between 3-20 characters and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** This file can be imported using `require` or `import` statements to utilize the input validation functions in user authentication processes.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session based on the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: for hashing passwords.
- `json`: for JSON serialization (not used in the current implementation).
- `datetime`: for handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: for calculating time differences.
- `typing`: for type hints (not used in the current implementation).
