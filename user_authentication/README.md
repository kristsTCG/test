# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles tasks such as validating user input and managing user authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate the validation logic implemented in `validator.js` (JavaScript) and the authentication functionality in `auth.py` (Python).

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Role:** Responsible for validating user input data.
- **Size:** 1212 characters
- **Usage:** Ensures that user-provided data meets specified criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.

### auth.py
- **Role:** Manages user authentication processes within the project.
- **Size:** 2198 characters
- **Usage:** Handles user login, registration, and authentication tasks using Python.

## Usage
1. **validator.js:**
   - Modify validation criteria as needed by updating the logic in `validator.js`.
   - Import the validator functions into other parts of the project where user input validation is required.

2. **auth.py:**
   - Utilize the authentication functions provided in `auth.py` for user login, registration, and authentication processes.
   - Ensure to integrate the authentication logic with other parts of the project that require user authentication.

By following the guidelines outlined in the key files, developers can effectively implement and manage user authentication functionalities within the project using the code provided in the `user_authentication` folder.
