# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder consists of two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file containing 1212 characters, responsible for user input validation.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters, managing user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This JavaScript file is crucial for validating user input data. It ensures that the data entered by users meets the required criteria and formats before proceeding with authentication.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is essential for handling user authentication within the project. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes using Python.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality, refer to the `validator.js` file and integrate the validation logic into your user input forms.
2. For user authentication processes, utilize the functions and methods defined in the `auth.py` file to manage user login, registration, and authentication within the project.
