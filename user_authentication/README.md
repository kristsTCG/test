# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication logic. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the project.

## Usage
Developers can utilize the `validator.js` file to implement input validation for user data. They can call the validation functions provided in this file to ensure data integrity and security.

For user authentication tasks, developers should refer to the `auth.py` file. It contains the necessary functions and methods to manage user authentication processes such as login, registration, and authentication checks.

Ensure that any modifications or additions to these files adhere to the project's authentication requirements and standards.
