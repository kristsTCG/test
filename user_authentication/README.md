The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files are responsible for validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder consists of two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters responsible for input validation.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Role**: Responsible for validating user input.
- **Character Count**: 1212
- **Language**: JavaScript

### auth.py
- **Role**: Handles user authentication processes.
- **Character Count**: 2198
- **Language**: Python

## Usage
1. To utilize the input validation functionality, refer to the `validator.js` file and incorporate the validation logic into your code.
2. For user authentication processes, utilize the functions and methods defined in the `auth.py` file. Ensure to follow the authentication flow as per the implementation in this file.

- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and a number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is 3-20 characters long and consists of alphanumeric characters and underscores only.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** This file can be imported into other JavaScript files using `require` or `import` statements to perform input validation for user authentication.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, logout, and session authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
