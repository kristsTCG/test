# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. It is responsible for validating user input and handling user authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` contains two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters that handles input validation for user authentication.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters that manages user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file is crucial for ensuring that user input for authentication is valid. It contains functions to validate user credentials, such as email addresses and passwords.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is essential for managing user authentication within the project. It handles processes such as user login, registration, and authentication token generation.

## Usage
1. To utilize the input validation functionality, refer to the `validator.js` file and integrate the validation functions into your user authentication forms.
2. For user authentication processes, utilize the functions and methods defined in the `auth.py` file. This includes handling user login, registration, and generating authentication tokens.

Ensure that you follow the coding standards and guidelines specified within each file for seamless integration and functionality.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username inputs, as well as determining the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on its complexity.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class where input validation is needed.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Register a new user with a unique username.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticate a user and return a session token.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: End a user session by invalidating the session token.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to manage user authentication. Call `register_user` to add a new user, `login` to authenticate and get a session token, `logout` to end a session, and `is_authenticated` to check session validity.

**Dependencies:** `hashlib`, `json`, `datetime`, `timedelta`, `Optional`, `Dict`
