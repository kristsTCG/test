# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the data provided by the user meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- `auth.py`: This Python file contains 2198 characters and handles the authentication process for users. It verifies user credentials and grants access based on the authentication rules defined in the project.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionality provided in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation criteria for user input data.
2. Examine the `auth.py` file to understand the authentication process and rules implemented in the project.
3. Integrate the authentication functionality into your project by importing and utilizing the necessary functions from these files.

Ensure that you adhere to the validation and authentication rules defined in the code to maintain secure user authentication processes.
