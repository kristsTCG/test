# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to include two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python. These files collectively manage user authentication tasks.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input data for authentication purposes.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file contains 2198 characters and handles the authentication logic for verifying user credentials and managing user sessions.

## Usage
To utilize the code in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Open and review the `validator.js` file to understand the user input validation process.
2. Examine the `auth.py` file to comprehend the authentication logic and session management.
3. Modify the code as needed to integrate user authentication features into the project.
4. Test the authentication functionalities thoroughly to ensure proper user validation and authentication processes.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is between 3-20 characters long and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on its length and character composition.

**Usage:** This file can be imported using `require` or `import` statements in other JavaScript files to perform input validation for user authentication.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token for active sessions.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by removing the session token from active sessions.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
