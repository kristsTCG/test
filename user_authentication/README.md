## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` contains two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters that handles input validation for user authentication.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters that manages user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- Role: Handles input validation for user authentication.
- Size: 1212 characters

### auth.py
- Role: Manages user authentication processes.
- Size: 2198 characters

## Usage
1. To utilize the input validation functionality, refer to the `validator.js` file and integrate the validation logic into your user authentication process.
2. For user authentication processes, refer to the `auth.py` file and utilize the functions provided to authenticate users within the system.
