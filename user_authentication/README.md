# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling the authentication processes within the project. It manages user login, registration, and authentication logic.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
1. Refer to `validator.js` for validating user input data before processing authentication requests.
2. Use `auth.py` for implementing user authentication processes such as login, registration, and authentication logic within the project.
