# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for authentication processes.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This file contains functions for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
- `auth.py`: This Python file handles the authentication logic for users. It manages user login, registration, and other authentication-related tasks.

## Usage
1. To utilize the input validation functionalities, refer to the `validator.js` file. You can call the validation functions within your code to ensure data integrity.
2. For user authentication tasks such as login and registration, interact with the `auth.py` file. This file provides the necessary functions to authenticate users securely.

Ensure to follow the coding standards and guidelines set within the project when working with the code in this folder.
