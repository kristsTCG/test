# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` for client-side input validation in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication logic in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input on the client-side. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submission.
- `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling server-side authentication processes. It manages user authentication, login, and authorization within the application.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Use `validator.js` functions to validate user input on the client-side by including the necessary scripts in your HTML files.
2. Utilize `auth.py` for server-side authentication tasks by importing and calling the relevant functions in your Python application.
3. Ensure that both client-side and server-side authentication processes are in sync to provide a secure and seamless user authentication experience.

- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength and format of a password.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** This file can be imported as a module in other JavaScript files to perform input validation for user authentication.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies are required for this file.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
