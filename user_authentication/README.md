# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for authentication processes.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This file contains functions for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
- `auth.py`: This file handles authentication tasks such as user login, registration, and session management. It is responsible for verifying user credentials and providing access to authenticated users.

## Usage
1. To use the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the necessary functions into your JavaScript files and call them to validate user input.
2. For authentication tasks, utilize the functions provided in `auth.py` by importing them into your Python scripts. These functions can be used to authenticate users, manage sessions, and handle user registration and login processes.
