# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is written in Python and focuses on the authentication logic for users. It manages the process of verifying user credentials and granting access to authorized users.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionality provided in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules applied to user input.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to comprehend the authentication logic implemented for user verification.
3. Integrate these files into your project as needed to enhance user authentication capabilities.

- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character complexity.

**Usage:** This file can be imported into other JavaScript files using `require` or `import` statements.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token for active sessions.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by removing the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication and session handling.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
