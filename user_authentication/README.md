# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes validation logic in JavaScript and authentication logic in Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks. The key components include a JavaScript file for input validation and a Python file for user authentication.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains input validation logic for user authentication. It is crucial for ensuring that user input meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
   
2. `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` handles user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication tasks within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the code in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Modify the `validator.js` file to adjust input validation rules as needed.
2. Use the functions in `auth.py` to implement user authentication features in the project.
3. Ensure that both files are integrated correctly with other project components for seamless user authentication functionality.
