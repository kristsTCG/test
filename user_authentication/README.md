# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It includes scripts for validating user input and handling user authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input, ensuring data integrity and security in the authentication process.
- **auth.py**: The Python script `auth.py` handles user authentication tasks such as user login, registration, and password management.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions provided in `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code using `import validator from './validator.js'`. You can then call the validation functions as needed in your authentication processes.
   
2. For Python-based authentication tasks, import the `auth.py` module into your Python script using `import auth`. You can then access the authentication functions defined within `auth.py` to manage user authentication operations.

Ensure to follow the documentation and comments within the files for a better understanding of the functions and their parameters.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username allowing alphanumeric characters and underscores within a specific length range.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Assesses the strength of a password based on length and character complexity.

**Usage:** To use this file, import it into your project using `require` or `import` statements, then call the desired validation functions as needed.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: for hashing functions.
- `json`: for JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: for date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: for time duration calculations.
- `typing.Optional`: for type hinting.
