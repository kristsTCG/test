## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` contains two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters responsible for user input validation.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters that manage user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Role**: Responsible for validating user input data.
- **Character Count**: 1212
- **Language**: JavaScript

### auth.py
- **Role**: Manages user authentication processes.
- **Character Count**: 2198
- **Language**: Python

## Usage
1. To utilize the user input validation functionality:
   - Open `validator.js` in a JavaScript environment.
   - Use the functions within the file to validate user input data.

2. To work with user authentication processes:
   - Open `auth.py` in a Python environment.
   - Implement the authentication logic as needed in your project.

Ensure to follow the coding standards and guidelines set within the files for seamless integration with the project's user authentication system.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates an email address based on a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates a password ensuring it meets specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates a username based on length and character restrictions.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class in your code and call the validation functions as needed.

```javascript
const InputValidator = require('./validator.js');

if (InputValidator.validateEmail('test@example.com')) {
    console.log('Email is valid');
}

if (InputValidator.validatePassword('StrongPassword123')) {
    console.log('Password is valid');
}

if (InputValidator.validateUsername('user_123')) {
    console.log('Username is valid');
}

const passwordStrength = InputValidator.getPasswordStrength('SecurePass123');
console.log('Password strength:', passwordStrength);
```

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticate a user and return a session token.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: End a user session.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to manage user authentication. Call `register_user` to create a new user, `login` to authenticate and get a session token, `logout` to end a session, and `is_authenticated` to check session validity.

**Dependencies:** `hashlib`, `json`, `datetime`, `timedelta`, `Optional`, `Dict`
