# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for authentication logic.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
   
2. **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is responsible for handling user authentication logic. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the system.

## Usage
To utilize the functionality provided in this folder:
- Use `validator.js` for validating user input before processing authentication tasks.
- Implement the authentication logic defined in `auth.py` to manage user authentication processes effectively.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username inputs, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric and underscore characters.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on various criteria.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class in your code and call the validation methods as needed.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user authentication operations.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** To use this file, create an instance of `UserAuth` and call its methods for user registration, login, logout, and session validation.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
