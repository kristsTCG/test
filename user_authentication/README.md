# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for authentication logic.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
   
2. `auth.py`: This file implements the authentication logic for verifying user credentials and managing user sessions. It is responsible for authenticating users and granting access to authorized resources.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions provided in `validator.js`, import the necessary functions into your JavaScript files and call them to validate user input data before processing it further.
   
2. For authentication tasks, import the `auth.py` module into your Python scripts. Use the functions within this file to authenticate users, manage user sessions, and control access to protected resources. Ensure proper error handling and logging mechanisms are in place for secure authentication processes.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length and character requirements.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username allowing alphanumeric characters and underscores within a specific length range.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character complexity.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class in your code and call the validation methods as needed.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token for active sessions.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by removing the session token from active sessions.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and still active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: Used for hashing passwords.
- `json`: Not used in this file but imported.
- `datetime`: Used for handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: Used for calculating expiration time for session tokens.
- `typing`: Used for type hints in function definitions.
