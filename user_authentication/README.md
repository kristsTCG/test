# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` for client-side input validation using JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication logic using Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic to ensure that user input meets specified criteria before submission.
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file handles server-side authentication processes, such as verifying user credentials and managing user sessions.

## Usage
1. To utilize the client-side validation functionality, refer to `validator.js` and integrate the validation logic into your front-end forms.
2. For server-side authentication tasks, consult `auth.py` to understand the authentication processes and incorporate them into your backend logic.
3. Ensure to maintain consistency between client-side and server-side validation to enhance security and user experience.

- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password.

**Usage:** This file can be imported into other JavaScript files using `require` or `import` statements to access the input validation functionalities provided by the `InputValidator` class.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, logout, and session validation.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token for active sessions.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session by removing the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For handling JSON data.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints in function definitions.
