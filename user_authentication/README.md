# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` and `auth.py`, written in JavaScript and Python respectively.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input data related to authentication processes. It ensures that the data entered by the user meets the required criteria.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file is 2198 characters long and handles the authentication logic for user login and access control. It verifies user credentials and manages user sessions.

## Usage
To utilize the functionality provided in this folder:
- Use `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing it for authentication.
- Implement the authentication logic defined in `auth.py` to authenticate users and manage their access to the system.
