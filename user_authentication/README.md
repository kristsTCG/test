## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: Responsible for validating user input data.
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Language: JavaScript

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Manages user authentication processes.
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Language: Python

## Usage
1. **validator.js**
   - To use the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code.
   - Call the appropriate validation functions provided in `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing.

2. **auth.py**
   - Import `auth.py` into your Python code to access the authentication functionalities.
   - Utilize the functions in `auth.py` to authenticate users based on the project's requirements.

Ensure that you understand the specific functions and methods provided in each file to effectively implement user authentication within the project.
