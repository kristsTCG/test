# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file contains authentication logic written in Python. It manages user authentication processes such as login, registration, and session management.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules and functions available.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to understand the authentication logic and how user authentication is handled within the project.
3. Integrate these files into your project as needed for user authentication purposes.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file contains input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username inputs, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class in your code and call the relevant validation functions as needed.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token if successful.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the session token provided.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid and the user is authenticated.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user registration, login, logout, and authentication operations.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: for hashing functions.
- `json`: for JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: for working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: for representing time differences.
- `typing`: for type hints.
