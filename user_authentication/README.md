# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for authentication logic.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that the data entered by users meets the required criteria.
   
2. `auth.py`: This file handles the authentication process for users. It includes functions for user login, registration, and other authentication-related tasks.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Use the functions defined in `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing it further.
2. Incorporate the authentication logic from `auth.py` to implement user authentication features in the project.
3. Ensure that the code in these files is integrated seamlessly with other parts of the project that require user authentication.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username inputs, as well as determining the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength and format of a password.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class in your code:
```javascript
const InputValidator = require('./validator.js');
```

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
    - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
    - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
    - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and generates a session token.
    - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the session token.
    - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: for hashing functions.
- `json`: for JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: for date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: for calculating time differences.
- `typing`: for type hinting.
