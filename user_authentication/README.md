# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It includes scripts for validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
- `auth.py`: The Python script `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication tasks within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
1. Refer to `validator.js` for user input validation functions and integrate them into your application's frontend validation processes.
2. Utilize `auth.py` for implementing user authentication features in your backend system. This script can be used for managing user login, registration, and authentication processes.

Ensure to maintain the integrity of the authentication system by following best practices and security measures when integrating these files into your project.
