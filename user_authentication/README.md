# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized with two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters responsible for validating user input.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters responsible for handling user authentication.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Role**: Responsible for validating user input.
- **Character Count**: 1212
- **Usage**: Ensures that user input meets specified criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.

### auth.py
- **Role**: Handles user authentication processes.
- **Character Count**: 2198
- **Usage**: Manages user login, registration, and authentication within the system.

## Usage
To utilize the code within the `user_authentication` folder:
1. Modify `validator.js` to customize input validation rules as needed.
2. Utilize `auth.py` functions for user authentication processes such as login and registration.
3. Ensure proper integration of these files within the overall project structure for seamless user authentication.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength and format of a password (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username (3-20 characters, alphanumeric and underscores only).
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token if successful.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the session token.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid and the user is authenticated.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization/deserialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
