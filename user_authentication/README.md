# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized with two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file containing functions for validating user input. (1212 characters)
- `auth.py`: A Python file handling authentication processes. (2198 characters)

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file is crucial for ensuring the validity of user input. It contains functions to validate various user data such as email addresses, passwords, and other input fields.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is responsible for managing user authentication within the project. It handles processes such as user login, registration, and authentication token generation.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code and call the necessary validation functions with the user input as parameters.

2. For authentication processes, import `auth.py` into your Python code. Use the functions provided within this file to handle user login, registration, and authentication token generation.

3. Ensure to follow any specific guidelines or documentation within each file for proper usage and integration within the project.
