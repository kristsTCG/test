# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This module handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side validation and auth.py for server-side authentication logic.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It ensures that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submission.
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for server-side authentication tasks. It manages user authentication, login, and session handling.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to match the project's requirements.
   - Include `validator.js` in your HTML files using `<script>` tags to enable client-side validation.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Integrate the authentication logic with your backend server.
   - Use the functions provided in `auth.py` to authenticate users and manage their sessions securely.

Ensure that both client-side and server-side authentication processes are synchronized to provide a seamless user experience.
