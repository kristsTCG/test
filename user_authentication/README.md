# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` for client-side validation written in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: Responsible for client-side validation of user input.
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Language: JavaScript

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Handles server-side authentication processes.
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Language: Python

## Usage
1. **validator.js**
   - Ensure the `validator.js` file is included in your HTML file using a script tag.
   - Use the functions provided in `validator.js` to validate user input on the client-side before submitting forms.

2. **auth.py**
   - Integrate `auth.py` into your server-side codebase to handle user authentication processes.
   - Utilize the functions and classes defined in `auth.py` to authenticate users and manage user sessions securely.

Remember to maintain the integrity and security of user authentication processes when working with the code in this folder.
