## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: Responsible for validating user input data.
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Language: JavaScript

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Handles user authentication processes.
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Language: Python

## Usage
1. **validator.js**
   - To use the validator for validating user input data, import the `validator.js` file into your JavaScript project.
   - Utilize the functions provided in `validator.js` to validate user inputs such as email addresses, passwords, etc.

2. **auth.py**
   - Import `auth.py` into your Python project to utilize user authentication functionalities.
