# user_authentication

## Overview
The user_authentication folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This folder is responsible for handling user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The user_authentication folder is organized with two key files:
- validator.js: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters, responsible for validating user input and ensuring data integrity.
- auth.py: A Python file with 2198 characters, responsible for handling user authentication logic and verifying user credentials.

## Key Files
### validator.js
The validator.js file is crucial for ensuring that user input is validated correctly before being processed further in the authentication flow. It plays a key role in maintaining data integrity and preventing potential security vulnerabilities.

### auth.py
The auth.py file is essential for managing user authentication within the project. It handles the authentication process, verifies user credentials, and grants access to authorized users. This file is critical for ensuring the security of user accounts and protecting sensitive information.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the validator.js file to understand the validation rules applied to user input.
2. Examine the auth.py file to understand the authentication logic and how user credentials are verified.
3. Modify the validation rules in validator.js as needed to customize the validation process.
4. Implement additional authentication features or security measures in auth.py to enhance user authentication within the project.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class from `validator.js` in your code.

```javascript
const InputValidator = require('./validator.js');

// Example usage
if (InputValidator.validateEmail('example@email.com')) {
    console.log('Email is valid');
}

console.log(InputValidator.getPasswordStrength('StrongPassword123'));
```

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.
