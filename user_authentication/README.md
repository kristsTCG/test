# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for authentication logic.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
- `auth.py`: This Python file is responsible for handling user authentication tasks. It includes functions for user login, registration, and authentication processes.

## Usage
1. To use the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the necessary functions into your JavaScript files and call them to validate user input data.
2. Utilize the functions provided in `auth.py` for user authentication tasks within your Python scripts. This includes user login, registration, and authentication functionalities.

Ensure to follow the documentation and comments within the files for a better understanding of the functions and their parameters.
