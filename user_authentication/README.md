## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder consists of two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file containing functions for validating user input.
- `auth.py`: A Python file responsible for handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- Role: This file contains functions for validating user input, ensuring data integrity and security.
- Size: 1212 characters

### auth.py
- Role: Manages user authentication processes, such as login, registration, and authorization.
- Size: 2198 characters

## Usage
1. To use the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the necessary functions into your JavaScript files.
2. Utilize the functions provided in `auth.py` to handle user authentication processes within your Python code.
3. Ensure proper error handling and data validation when integrating these files into your project to maintain security and data integrity.
