# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` for client-side validation written in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: Handles client-side validation of user input.
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Language: JavaScript

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Manages server-side authentication processes.
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Language: Python

## Usage
1. To utilize the client-side validation provided by `validator.js`, include this file in your HTML code using a script tag.
   ```html
   <script src="path/to/validator.js"></script>
   ```

2. For server-side authentication functionalities, import and use `auth.py` in your Python project.
   ```python
   from user_authentication.auth import authenticate_user
   ```

3. Ensure to configure and customize the authentication logic as per your project requirements in `auth.py`.

4. Collaborate with the frontend and backend teams to integrate user authentication seamlessly across the application.

- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password()`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user()`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login()`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token for active sessions.
- `logout()`: Method to end a user session by removing the session token from active sessions.
- `is_authenticated()`: Method to check if a session token is valid and not expired.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class and use its methods to register users, log in, log out, and check authentication status.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
