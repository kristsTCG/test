# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This functionality is responsible for validating user input and handling user authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` consists of two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters, responsible for validating user input data.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters, responsible for handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Role**: Responsible for validating user input data.
- **Character Count**: 1212
- **Usage**: Ensures that user input data meets specified criteria and formats.

### auth.py
- **Role**: Handles user authentication processes.
- **Character Count**: 2198
- **Usage**: Manages user login, registration, and authentication functionalities.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality, refer to `validator.js` and incorporate the validation methods into your code where necessary.
2. For user authentication processes, utilize the functions and methods provided in `auth.py` to handle user login, registration, and authentication within the project.
