## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the data provided by the user meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file is 2198 characters long and manages the authentication process for users. It handles user login, registration, and authentication using secure methods.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
- Use `validator.js` to validate user input data before authentication.
- Utilize `auth.py` for user authentication processes such as login, registration, and secure authentication methods.

Ensure to follow the coding standards and guidelines specified within each file for seamless integration with the user authentication system.
