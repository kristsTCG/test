# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate the validation logic in `validator.js` written in JavaScript and the authentication logic in `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains the validation logic for user input. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
- **auth.py**: This file contains the authentication logic for verifying user credentials and granting access to authorized users.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to suit the project requirements.
   - Import the necessary functions from this file into other parts of the project where user input validation is required.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Implement additional authentication methods or strategies based on project needs.
   - Integrate the authentication logic into the relevant parts of the project to secure user access.

Ensure that any modifications made to these files are thoroughly tested to maintain the security and integrity of the user authentication process.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength level of a password based on various criteria.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class into your code and call its static methods for input validation.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with username, email, and password.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Import `auth.py` and create an instance of `UserAuth` to utilize the user authentication functionalities.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization/deserialization.
- `datetime`: For handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
