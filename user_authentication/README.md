## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Type: JavaScript
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Role: Responsible for validating user input data to ensure it meets specified criteria. This file plays a crucial role in maintaining data integrity and security.

2. **auth.py**
   - Type: Python
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Role: Contains authentication logic for verifying user credentials and managing user sessions. This file is essential for securing user accounts and controlling access to protected resources.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**
   - To use the validation functions provided in `validator.js`, import the module into your JavaScript files using `require` or `import`.
   - Call the appropriate validation functions with user input data to ensure it meets the required criteria before processing.

2. **auth.py**
   - Import the `auth` module into your Python scripts to access the authentication functionalities.
   - Utilize the provided functions to authenticate users, manage sessions, and enforce access control policies within your application.

Ensure to follow best practices for user authentication and data validation when working with the code in this folder.

- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the session token.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For handling date and time.
