# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input related to authentication. It ensures that the input data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file contains 2198 characters and handles the authentication logic for users. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the system.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
- Review `validator.js` to understand the validation rules for user input.
- Explore `auth.py` to understand the authentication flow and processes for users.
- Modify the code as needed to customize authentication behavior or integrate with other parts of the project.
