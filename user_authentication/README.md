## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes the following key components:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters responsible for validating user input.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Role**: Responsible for validating user input.
- **Character Count**: 1212
- **Usage**: Ensures that user-provided data meets specified criteria before processing.

### auth.py
- **Role**: Manages user authentication processes.
- **Character Count**: 2198
- **Usage**: Handles user login, registration, and authentication tasks.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality:
   - Open `validator.js` and review the validation rules implemented.
   - Integrate the validation functions into your code by importing them where needed.

2. To work with user authentication processes:
   - Refer to `auth.py` for functions related to user login, registration, and authentication.
   - Implement these functions in your project to enable user authentication features.
