# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate the validation logic implemented in JavaScript in `validator.js` and the authentication logic implemented in Python in `auth.py`.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains the JavaScript code for validating user inputs and ensuring data integrity before authentication.
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file houses the Python code responsible for authenticating users based on their credentials.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation logic, refer to `validator.js` and integrate the functions provided for validating user inputs.
2. For user authentication, utilize the functions and methods defined in `auth.py` to authenticate users based on their credentials.
3. Ensure to maintain the integrity and security of user data throughout the authentication process.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username inputs, as well as determining the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character requirements.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class in your code and call the desired validation functions as needed.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session based on the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to access user authentication functionalities like registering users, logging in, logging out, and checking session validity.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib` for hashing functions.
- `json` for JSON serialization.
- `datetime` for handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta` for time duration calculations.
- `typing` for type hints.
