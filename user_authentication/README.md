# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- Role: Responsible for validating user input data.
- Size: 1212 characters
- Language: JavaScript

### auth.py
- Role: Manages user authentication processes.
- Size: 2198 characters
- Language: Python

## Usage
1. To utilize the input validation functionality, refer to `validator.js`. This file contains functions to validate user input data before processing.
2. For user authentication tasks, such as login and registration, refer to `auth.py`. This file handles authentication logic and processes within the project.

Ensure to maintain the integrity of the code and follow best practices while working with the files in this folder.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and a number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is 3-20 characters long, alphanumeric, and contains underscores only.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character complexity.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
