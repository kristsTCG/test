# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder consists of two key files:
- `validator.js` (JavaScript): Contains functions for validating user input.
- `auth.py` (Python): Implements user authentication logic.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file contains functions for validating user input to ensure data integrity and security.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is responsible for handling user authentication processes, such as login, logout, and user session management.

## Usage
To utilize the functionality provided by the `user_authentication` folder:
1. Use the functions defined in `validator.js` to validate user input before processing.
2. Import and utilize the authentication logic implemented in `auth.py` for user authentication within the project.
