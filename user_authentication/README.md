# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized with two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for client-side validation and `auth.py` written in Python for server-side authentication.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submission.
   
2. `auth.py`: The `auth.py` file is responsible for server-side authentication processes. It handles user authentication, login, and authorization within the application.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
- Modify the validation rules in `validator.js` to customize input validation criteria.
- Implement additional authentication logic in `auth.py` as needed for user authentication.
- Ensure proper integration of these files with other parts of the project that require user authentication functionalities.
