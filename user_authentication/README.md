# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validating user inputs and handling user authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user inputs, ensuring data integrity and security.
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes, such as login, registration, and password management.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review `validator.js` for input validation functions and ensure they are integrated into user input forms.
2. Utilize `auth.py` for implementing user authentication features in the project, such as login and registration functionalities.
3. Ensure proper error handling and security measures are in place when using these files for user authentication processes.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username allowing alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** This file can be imported into other JavaScript files using `require` or `import` statements, and the functions can be called with appropriate input values.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password()`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user()`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login()`: Method to authenticate a user with username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout()`: Method to end a user session based on the session token.
- `is_authenticated()`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize user authentication functionalities like registration, login, logout, and session validation.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For handling JSON data.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
