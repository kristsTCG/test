- `auth.py`: A Python file responsible for handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Role**: Contains functions for validating user inputs and data.
- **Size**: 1212 characters
- **Usage**: Used to ensure that user-provided data meets specified criteria before processing.

### auth.py
- **Role**: Manages user authentication processes within the project.
- **Size**: 2198 characters
- **Usage**: Responsible for authenticating users and granting access based on credentials.

## Usage
1. Utilize `validator.js` functions to validate user inputs and data before processing.
