# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes the following key components:
- `validator.js`: JavaScript file for user input validation with 1212 characters.
- `auth.py`: Python file for user authentication logic with 2198 characters.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Role**: Handles user input validation.
- **Character Count**: 1212
- **Usage**: Ensures that user input meets specified criteria before proceeding with authentication.

### auth.py
- **Role**: Manages user authentication processes.
- **Character Count**: 2198
- **Usage**: Implements authentication logic to verify user credentials and grant access to authorized users.

## Usage
1. To utilize the user input validation functionality, refer to `validator.js`. Customize validation rules as needed for the project requirements.
2. For user authentication tasks, utilize `auth.py` to authenticate users based on provided credentials. Implement additional security measures as necessary.

Ensure that the code in this folder is integrated correctly with other project components to maintain secure user authentication processes.
