# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for authentication logic.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
   
2. **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is responsible for handling user authentication logic. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the system.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review and understand the functions defined in `validator.js` for input validation requirements.
2. Utilize the functions provided in `auth.py` for user authentication processes such as login and registration.
3. Ensure to integrate these files into the larger project structure to enable user authentication functionalities.
