# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` for client-side input validation written in JavaScript, and `auth.py` for server-side authentication logic written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic for user inputs. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submission.
- **auth.py**: This file handles server-side authentication processes. It manages user authentication, login, and authorization within the application.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to suit the project requirements.
   - Integrate the validation functions with user input forms to enhance data integrity.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Implement additional authentication methods or strategies as required.
   - Utilize the authentication functions provided in this file to secure user access to protected resources.

Ensure that both client-side and server-side authentication mechanisms work seamlessly together to provide a secure and user-friendly authentication experience.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file contains input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates an email address format using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates a password format requiring at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and a number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates a username format requiring 3-20 characters, alphanumeric characters, and underscores only.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
