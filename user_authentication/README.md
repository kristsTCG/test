# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This component is responsible for validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side input validation and auth.py for server-side authentication logic.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation logic to ensure that user input meets specified criteria before submission.
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` handles server-side authentication processes, such as verifying user credentials and managing user sessions.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication features in this folder:
1. Use `validator.js` to implement client-side input validation by including the necessary scripts in your HTML files.
2. Incorporate `auth.py` into your server-side code to manage user authentication processes, such as login, registration, and session handling.

Ensure that both client-side and server-side components work seamlessly together to provide a secure and user-friendly authentication experience.
