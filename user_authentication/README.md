# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to include two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file containing functions for validating user input.
- `auth.py`: A Python file responsible for user authentication logic.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- Role: Handles user input validation.
- Size: 1212 characters.
- Language: JavaScript.

### auth.py
- Role: Manages user authentication processes.
- Size: 2198 characters.
- Language: Python.

## Usage
1. To utilize the user input validation functions in `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code and call the necessary validation functions as needed.
2. For user authentication functionalities, import `auth.py` into your Python code and utilize the authentication logic provided within the file.

Ensure that you understand the functions and methods provided in each file before integrating them into your project for seamless user authentication processes.
