# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized with two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file containing functions for validating user input. (1212 characters)
- `auth.py`: A Python file responsible for handling user authentication processes. (2198 characters)

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file is crucial for ensuring that user input meets specified criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is essential for managing user authentication within the project. It handles user login, registration, and authentication logic.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review `validator.js` for input validation functions and ensure they align with project requirements.
2. Understand the logic implemented in `auth.py` for user authentication processes.
3. Modify and extend the code as needed to customize authentication functionalities for the project.

- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength level of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies are required for this file.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the session token.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to utilize user authentication functionalities like registration, login, logout, and session validation.

**Dependencies:** `hashlib`, `json`, `datetime`, `timedelta`, `typing`.
