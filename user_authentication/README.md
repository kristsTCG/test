# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This module handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters of code and is responsible for validating user input data for authentication purposes.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file contains 2198 characters of code and manages the authentication logic for users within the system.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand how user input data is validated.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to understand the authentication logic and processes implemented for users.
3. Modify the code as needed to customize user authentication functionality for your project.
