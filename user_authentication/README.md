# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This functionality is responsible for validating user input and handling user authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` contains two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters, responsible for validating user input data.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters, responsible for handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Role**: Validates user input data.
- **Character Count**: 1212
- **Usage**: Used to ensure that user input meets specified criteria before processing.

### auth.py
- **Role**: Handles user authentication processes.
- **Character Count**: 2198
- **Usage**: Manages user authentication, login, and logout functionalities.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality, refer to the `validator.js` file and incorporate the validation logic into your code.
2. To implement user authentication processes, refer to the `auth.py` file and integrate the authentication logic into your application.
3. Ensure that the functions and methods from these files are appropriately imported and called within your project to enable user authentication features.
