# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for handling authentication logic.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
  
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is responsible for managing user authentication within the project. It handles tasks such as user login, registration, and authentication checks. This file is essential for maintaining the security and integrity of user accounts.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules and functions available for user input.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to familiarize yourself with the authentication logic and functions implemented for user authentication.
3. Use the functions provided in these files to integrate user authentication features into your project.
4. Ensure to follow best practices for user authentication and data validation to enhance the security of the application.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Returns the strength level of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token for active sessions.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by removing the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations like registration, login, logout, and session validation.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
