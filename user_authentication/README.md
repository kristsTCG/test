The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This functionality is crucial for managing user access and security.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side validation and auth.py for server-side authentication logic.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submission.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for server-side authentication processes. It handles user authentication, login, and session management, ensuring secure access to the application.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Utilize `validator.js` for client-side validation by including it in your HTML files and calling the necessary validation functions.
2. Incorporate `auth.py` into your server-side code to manage user authentication. Ensure to configure it according to your project's authentication requirements.
3. Maintain the integrity and security of user authentication processes by regularly updating and testing the code in this folder.
