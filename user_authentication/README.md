# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes a JavaScript file for validation logic and a Python file for authentication processes.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the data entered by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python file contains 2198 characters and handles the authentication processes for users. It verifies user credentials and grants access based on the authentication results.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality, refer to the `validator.js` file and integrate the validation logic into your user input forms.
2. For authentication processes, utilize the `auth.py` file by calling the necessary functions to authenticate users based on their credentials.
