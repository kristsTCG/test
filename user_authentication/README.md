# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication features efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters of code and is responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file consists of 2198 characters of code and manages the authentication process for users. It handles user login, registration, and authentication logic.

## Usage
To utilize the code in this folder effectively:
- Review `validator.js` to understand the validation rules applied to user input.
- Explore `auth.py` to grasp the authentication flow and processes for users.
- Integrate the functions from these files into the project's user authentication system as needed.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength and format of a password.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies required for this file.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token for active sessions.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session by removing the session token from active sessions.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations like registration, login, logout, and session validation.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib` for password hashing.
- `json` for JSON serialization (not used in the provided code).
- `datetime` for handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta` from `datetime` for managing session expiration.
- `typing.Optional` and `typing.Dict` for type hints.
