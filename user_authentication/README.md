# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It includes validation logic in JavaScript and authentication logic in Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication processes. The `validator.js` file handles input validation for user data, while the `auth.py` file manages user authentication using Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains 1212 characters of JavaScript code responsible for validating user input data to ensure it meets specified criteria.
- **auth.py**: With 2198 characters of Python code, this file manages user authentication processes, such as login, registration, and session management.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation logic, refer to the `validator.js` file and integrate the validation functions into your user input forms.
2. For user authentication functionalities, utilize the `auth.py` file by importing the necessary functions and incorporating them into your authentication processes.
3. Ensure to follow the defined validation criteria and authentication flow to maintain secure user interactions within the project.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and a number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is between 3 to 20 characters long and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of the input password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file and use its static methods for input validation and password strength assessment.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py
