# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for authentication processes.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This file is responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the data entered by users meets the required criteria and is safe for processing.
   
2. **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file handles user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication mechanisms within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
- Use `validator.js` for validating user input data before processing.
- Incorporate `auth.py` for managing user authentication processes such as login and registration.

Ensure to follow the specific functions and methods defined in each file for seamless integration with the user authentication system in the project.
