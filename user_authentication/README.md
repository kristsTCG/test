# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This file contains JavaScript code (1212 characters) responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the data entered by the user meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file (2198 characters) handles the authentication process for users. It includes functions for verifying user credentials, generating tokens, and managing user sessions.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality, refer to `validator.js` and integrate the validation logic into your user input forms.
   
2. For user authentication tasks, utilize the functions provided in `auth.py` to authenticate users, generate tokens, and manage user sessions within your application.

Ensure to maintain the integrity of user data and follow security best practices when implementing authentication features using the code in this folder.

- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Evaluates the strength of a password and returns a descriptive level.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class where input validation is needed.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** User authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class managing user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Import `auth.py` and create an instance of `UserAuth` to utilize user authentication functionalities.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hinting.
