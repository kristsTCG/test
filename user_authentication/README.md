# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input data for authentication purposes.
- **auth.py**: This Python file with 2198 characters manages the authentication logic for users, including login, logout, and session management.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand how user input data is validated.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to grasp the authentication process, including login and session management.
3. Make necessary modifications or enhancements to suit the project's authentication requirements.

- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates a password based on length and character requirements.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates a username for length and character constraints.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character complexity.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class in your code and call the validation functions as needed.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For handling date and time operations.
