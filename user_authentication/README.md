# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This module handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` consists of two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python. These files are responsible for implementing user validation and authentication logic.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.

2. `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication. It includes functions for verifying user credentials, generating tokens, and managing user sessions.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided by the `user_authentication` module, follow these steps:
1. Include the necessary file (`validator.js` or `auth.py`) in your project.
2. Call the appropriate functions from the files to validate user input data or authenticate users.
3. Implement the returned results in your project's authentication flow.

Ensure that you understand the specific functions and methods provided in each file to effectively integrate user authentication features into your project.
