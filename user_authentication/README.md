# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes a JavaScript file for validation logic and a Python file for authentication functionality.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters of code and is responsible for validating user input data.
- `auth.py`: This Python file contains 2198 characters of code and handles user authentication processes.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication features in this folder:
1. Modify the validation logic in `validator.js` to suit the project's requirements.
2. Implement the authentication processes in `auth.py` as needed.
3. Ensure that both files are integrated correctly within the project's authentication flow.
