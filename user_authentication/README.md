   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Role: Manages user authentication processes such as login, registration, and session handling using Python.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**
   - To use the `validator.js` file, import it into your JavaScript code using `require` or `import` statements.
   - Utilize the functions within `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing it further.
   - Customize the validation criteria as needed for your specific project requirements.

2. **auth.py**
   - Incorporate the `auth.py` file into your Python project by importing it using `import auth`.
   - Call the authentication functions provided in `auth.py` to handle user login, registration, and session management.
   - Ensure to configure the authentication settings and database connections as per your project setup.
