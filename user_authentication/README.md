# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input, ensuring that data entered by users meets specified criteria. It plays a crucial role in maintaining data integrity and security.
- `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` handles user authentication processes such as login, logout, and user session management. It is responsible for verifying user credentials and ensuring secure access to the system.

## Usage
Developers can utilize the `validator.js` file to implement client-side validation for user input forms, enhancing the user experience by providing immediate feedback on data entry. The `auth.py` file can be integrated into the backend system to manage user authentication securely. Developers should refer to the specific functions within each file for detailed usage instructions.
