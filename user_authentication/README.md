# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for authentication logic.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
  
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is responsible for handling user authentication logic. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the application.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the input validation requirements and functions available.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to grasp the authentication logic implemented in the project.
3. Integrate these files into your project as needed for user authentication purposes.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username inputs, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is between 3 to 20 characters long and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on its length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Method to register a new user.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Method to authenticate a user and return a session token.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Method to end a user session.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to use the provided user authentication functionality.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For handling date and time.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
