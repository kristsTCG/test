# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder contains two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters responsible for validating user input.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file is crucial for validating user input to ensure data integrity and security. It plays a key role in preventing malicious input and ensuring that only valid data is processed.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is essential for user authentication within the project. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes to ensure secure access to the system.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality, refer to the `validator.js` file and integrate the validation methods into your codebase.
2. For user authentication processes, interact with the `auth.py` file to handle user login, registration, and authentication within the project.

Ensure to follow best practices and security measures when working with user authentication functionality to safeguard user data and system integrity.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file contains input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** This file can be imported as a module in other JavaScript files to perform input validation for user authentication.

**Dependencies:** None

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class managing user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to access user authentication functionalities.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For handling date and time.
- `timedelta`: For time-based calculations.
- `typing`: For type hints.
