# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles validation and authentication of user credentials.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication processes efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side validation and auth.py for server-side authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submission.
- **auth.py**: This Python file is responsible for server-side authentication of user credentials. It handles the verification of user identity and authorization processes.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to suit the project's requirements.
   - Include the validator.js file in your HTML pages using `<script>` tags.
   - Call the validation functions from your form submission logic to validate user input.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Implement additional authentication methods or strategies as required.
   - Integrate the auth.py file with your backend server logic to authenticate users during login or access control processes.
   - Ensure proper error handling and secure storage of user credentials within the authentication logic.

By following the guidelines above, you can effectively utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this folder.
