# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This functionality is crucial for managing user access and security.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side validation and auth.py for server-side authentication logic.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation functions to ensure that user input meets specified criteria before submitting it for authentication.
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for server-side authentication processes. It handles user login, registration, and authentication logic.

## Usage
1. Use `validator.js` to implement client-side validation for user input forms. Import the necessary functions and integrate them into your frontend code.
2. Utilize `auth.py` for server-side authentication tasks. Implement the provided functions for user login, registration, and authentication within your backend application.

Ensure that both client-side and server-side authentication processes are synchronized to maintain a secure and seamless user authentication experience.
