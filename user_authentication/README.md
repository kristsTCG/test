# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input data related to authentication. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file is 2198 characters long and handles the authentication logic for users. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the functionality provided in the `user_authentication` folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules for user input data.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to understand the authentication logic implemented for user registration and login processes.
3. Integrate the validation and authentication functions from these files into your project as needed for user authentication purposes.
