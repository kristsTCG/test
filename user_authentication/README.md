# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file, spanning 2198 characters, manages the authentication logic for users. It handles user login, registration, and other authentication-related tasks within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionality in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules applied to user input.
2. Examine the `auth.py` file to comprehend the authentication logic implemented for user registration and login processes.
3. Integrate these files into your project to enable secure user authentication mechanisms.
