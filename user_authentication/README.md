# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It includes a JavaScript file for validation and a Python file for handling authentication.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication processes efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` for client-side validation and `auth.py` for server-side authentication.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file (1212 characters) is responsible for client-side validation of user input data. It ensures that the data entered by users meets the required criteria before submission.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file (2198 characters) handles server-side authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication against the system.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - To use the validation functions in `validator.js`, include the file in your HTML document using a script tag.
   - Call the appropriate validation functions on user input fields to ensure data integrity before submission.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Import `auth.py` in your Python project to access the authentication functionalities.
   - Utilize the provided functions for user registration, login, and authentication within your application.

Ensure that both client-side and server-side validation mechanisms are in sync to maintain a secure and user-friendly authentication process.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file contains input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates an email address based on a regular expression pattern.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates a password based on specific criteria (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates a username based on length and character restrictions.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in other parts of the application.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the session token.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to use the provided user authentication functionalities.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For handling date and time.
- `timedelta`: For time-based calculations.
- `typing`: For type hints.
