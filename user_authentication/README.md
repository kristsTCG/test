# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This module handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate the backend and frontend components of user authentication. The `validator.js` file contains JavaScript code for client-side validation, while the `auth.py` file contains Python code for server-side authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It ensures that user-provided data meets specified criteria before submission.
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is responsible for server-side user authentication. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes using Python.

## Usage
1. To use the client-side validation functionality, refer to the `validator.js` file and integrate the validation logic into your frontend forms.
2. For server-side authentication, utilize the functions defined in the `auth.py` file to handle user login, registration, and authentication processes within your backend application.
3. Ensure that the validation criteria and authentication methods meet the security requirements of your project before deployment.
