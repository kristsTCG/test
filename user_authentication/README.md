# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side input validation and auth.py for server-side authentication logic.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation functions to ensure that user input meets specified criteria before submission.
- **auth.py**: This Python file handles server-side authentication processes, such as verifying user credentials and generating access tokens.

## Usage
1. Use `validator.js` functions to validate user input on the client-side before submitting forms.
2. Incorporate `auth.py` methods to authenticate users on the server-side and manage user sessions securely.
