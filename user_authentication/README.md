# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes scripts for validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` for client-side validation written in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication logic written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input on the client-side. It ensures that user-provided data meets specified criteria before submission.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python script `auth.py` is responsible for handling server-side authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication logic to ensure secure access to the application.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
1. Modify the validation criteria in `validator.js` as per project requirements.
2. Integrate the server-side authentication logic from `auth.py` into the backend of the application.
3. Ensure proper communication between client-side validation and server-side authentication for a seamless user authentication experience.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file contains input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and a number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is between 3-20 characters long and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of the input password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with username, email, and password.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to use the provided authentication functionalities.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For representing time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
