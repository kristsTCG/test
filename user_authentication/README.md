## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This file contains JavaScript code (1212 characters) responsible for validating user input data for authentication purposes.
- `auth.py`: This Python file (2198 characters) handles the authentication logic for verifying user credentials and granting access.

## Usage
Developers can use the `validator.js` file to ensure that user input data meets the required criteria for authentication.
