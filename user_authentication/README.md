# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side validation and auth.py for server-side authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It ensures that user-provided data meets specified criteria before submission.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python file handles server-side authentication processes. It verifies user credentials, generates tokens, and manages user sessions.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify validation rules as needed to suit project requirements.
   - Include the script in HTML files where user input validation is required.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Configure authentication settings such as token expiration time and hashing algorithms.
   - Integrate authentication endpoints with the project's backend to secure user access.

Ensure to test the functionality of both files thoroughly to maintain a secure and user-friendly authentication system.
