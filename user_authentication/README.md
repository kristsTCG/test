# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input data related to authentication processes.
- `auth.py`: This Python file is 2198 characters long and handles authentication logic, such as user login, registration, and token generation.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionalities, refer to `validator.js` and incorporate the validation methods into your user input forms.
2. For authentication processes, interact with `auth.py` to implement user login, registration, and token generation features in your project.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numeric characters.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username, allowing only alphanumeric characters and underscores within a specific length range.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types, returning a descriptive strength level.

**Usage:** This file can be imported into other JavaScript files using `require` or `import` statements to access the input validation functionalities provided by the `InputValidator` class.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies and can be used independently for input validation tasks in user authentication processes.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes the password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token for active sessions.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the session token.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to manage user authentication operations. Call `register_user` to add a new user, `login` to authenticate a user and get a session token, `logout` to end a user session, and `is_authenticated` to check the validity of a session token.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: for hashing functions.
- `json`: for JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: for handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: for calculating time differences.
- `typing`: for type hinting in Python.
