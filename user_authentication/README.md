## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: Handles input validation for user authentication.
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Language: JavaScript

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Manages user authentication processes.
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Language: Python

## Usage
1. **validator.js**
   - Modify the validation rules as needed for user input data.
   - Ensure to include this file in any script that requires input validation for user authentication.

2. **auth.py**
