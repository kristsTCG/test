# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side input validation and auth.py for server-side authentication logic.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets specified criteria before submission.
   
2. **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for server-side authentication processes. It manages user authentication, login, and authorization within the application.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to suit the project requirements.
   - Include the `validator.js` file in your HTML templates using `<script>` tags.
   - Call the validation functions from your form submission logic to validate user input.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Implement additional authentication methods or customize existing ones based on project needs.
   - Integrate the authentication logic with your backend server code.
   - Ensure proper error handling and security measures are in place to protect user data.

By following the guidelines above, you can effectively utilize the user authentication functionality provided in this folder for your project.
