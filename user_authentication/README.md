# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side input validation and auth.py for server-side authentication logic.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It ensures that user-provided data meets specified criteria before submission.
- **auth.py**: This Python file handles server-side authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication against stored credentials.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**: To use the client-side validation logic, include `validator.js` in your HTML file using a script tag. You can then call the validation functions provided within this file to validate user input before form submission.
   
2. **auth.py**: Utilize the functions defined in `auth.py` to manage user authentication on the server-side. Import `auth.py` into your Python project and call the appropriate functions to handle user login, registration, and authentication processes. Ensure to securely store user credentials and manage authentication tokens as needed.
