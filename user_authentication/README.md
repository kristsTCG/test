# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling the authentication process. It manages user login, registration, and authentication tasks within the system.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions provided in `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code using `import validator from './validator.js'`. You can then call the validation functions as needed to validate user input data.

2. For authentication tasks, import `auth.py` into your Python code using `import auth`. Use the functions within `auth.py` to manage user authentication processes such as login and registration.

3. Ensure that you understand the specific functions and methods available in each file to effectively implement user authentication features in your project.
