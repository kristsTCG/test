# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` for client-side validation written in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submission.
  
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file handles server-side authentication processes. It is responsible for verifying user credentials, generating tokens, and managing user sessions.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to match the project's requirements.
   - Include the `validator.js` file in your HTML pages using a script tag.
   - Call the validation functions from your form submission logic to validate user input.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Configure the authentication settings such as token expiration time and hashing algorithms.
   - Integrate the authentication logic into your server-side application to handle user login and authentication.
   - Securely store sensitive information such as secret keys and database connection details.
   - Implement error handling and logging to track authentication-related issues.

By following the guidelines above, you can effectively utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in the `user_authentication` folder for your project.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user authentication, registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by invalidating the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** To use this file, create an instance of `UserAuth` and call its methods for user registration, login, logout, and session validation.

**Dependencies:** This file imports `hashlib`, `json`, `datetime`, `timedelta`, and `Optional` and `Dict` types from the `typing` module.
