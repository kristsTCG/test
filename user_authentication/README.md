# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The `user_authentication` folder contains two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters that handles user input validation.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters responsible for user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- Role: Handles user input validation.
- Description: This file contains functions to validate user input data to ensure it meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.

### auth.py
- Role: Manages user authentication processes.
- Description: This Python file contains functions and logic for authenticating users, verifying credentials, and managing user sessions.

## Usage
1. To use the validation functionalities provided by `validator.js`, import the necessary functions into your JavaScript files and call them to validate user input data.

Example:
```javascript
import { validateUsername, validatePassword } from './validator.js';

const username = 'example_user';
if (validateUsername(username)) {
    // Proceed with authentication
} else {
    // Display error message
}
```

2. Utilize the authentication functionalities in `auth.py` by importing the necessary functions and incorporating them into your Python scripts for user authentication processes.

Example:
```python
from auth import authenticate_user

username = 'example_user'
password = 'secure_password'
if authenticate_user(username, password):
    # User authentication successful
else:
    # User authentication failed
```

Ensure to follow the specific usage guidelines provided within each file for seamless integration into your project.
