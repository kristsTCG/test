# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` consists of two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python. These files are responsible for user input validation and authentication logic, respectively.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**:
   - Language: JavaScript
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Role: Handles user input validation to ensure data integrity and security.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Language: Python
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Role: Manages user authentication processes, such as login, registration, and session management.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided by the `user_authentication` folder, follow these steps:
1. Ensure that both `validator.js` and `auth.py` are included in your project.
2. Use the functions defined in `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing.
3. Implement the authentication logic from `auth.py` to handle user login, registration, and session management within your application.

By integrating these files into your project, you can enhance the security and reliability of user authentication processes.
