## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder consists of two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters that contains functions for validating user input.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters that handles user authentication logic.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file contains functions to validate user input, ensuring data integrity and security.

### auth.py
This file is responsible for authenticating users, managing user sessions, and enforcing access control within the application.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the necessary functions into your JavaScript files and call them as needed to validate user input.
2. For user authentication functionalities, import and use the methods provided in `auth.py` to authenticate users, manage sessions, and control access to different parts of the application.
