# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes validation logic in JavaScript and authentication logic in Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks. The key components include a JavaScript file for validation and a Python file for authentication.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains validation logic for user inputs. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user data meets the required criteria before authentication.
- `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication tasks within the system.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review `validator.js` to understand the validation rules applied to user inputs.
2. Explore `auth.py` to grasp the authentication mechanisms implemented in the system.
3. Use the functions and classes defined in these files to integrate user authentication features into the project.
