# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It likely includes functions for user login, registration, and authentication checks.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation logic and criteria for user input.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to understand the authentication processes and functions available.
3. Use the functions provided in these files to implement user authentication features in the project.

- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on various criteria.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, logout, and session authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to access user authentication functionalities.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: for hashing passwords.
