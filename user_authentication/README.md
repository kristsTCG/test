# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input data for authentication purposes.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file consists of 2198 characters and handles the authentication logic for users within the system.

## Usage
Developers can utilize the `validator.js` file to validate user input data before processing authentication requests. The `auth.py` file can be used to implement user authentication functionalities within the project. Ensure to follow the code structure and guidelines specified in each file for seamless integration with the project's user authentication system.
