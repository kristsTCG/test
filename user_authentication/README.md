# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This functionality is crucial for managing user access and security.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side validation and auth.py for server-side authentication logic.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It plays a key role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submission.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for server-side authentication processes. It manages user authentication, login, and authorization within the system.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to match the project's requirements.
   - Include this file in your HTML templates to enable client-side validation.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Implement additional authentication methods or customize the existing ones.
   - Integrate the authentication logic with other parts of the system that require user authentication.

Ensure that both client-side and server-side authentication mechanisms work seamlessly together to provide a secure user authentication experience.
