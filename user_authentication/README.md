# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles tasks such as validating user input and managing user authentication using JavaScript and Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate the validation logic (validator.js) written in JavaScript and the authentication logic (auth.py) written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains the validation logic for user input. It ensures that the data entered by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The auth.py file handles user authentication using Python. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the system.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to suit the project requirements.
   - Include the validator.js file in relevant parts of the project where user input validation is required.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Implement additional authentication features or customize the existing logic to align with the project's authentication requirements.
   - Integrate the auth.py file with other parts of the project that require user authentication functionalities.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username, allowing alphanumeric characters and underscores only.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password()`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user()`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login()`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout()`: Method to end a user session.
- `is_authenticated()`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For handling JSON data.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
