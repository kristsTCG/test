# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file consists of 2198 characters and manages the authentication process for users. It handles user login, registration, and authentication tasks using Python programming.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionality in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules for user input data.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to implement user authentication processes in Python.
3. Integrate these files into your project to enable secure user authentication mechanisms.
