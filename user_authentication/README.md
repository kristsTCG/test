# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This folder is responsible for validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` consists of two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters that handles input validation for user authentication.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters that manages the authentication logic for users.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Role**: Responsible for validating user input data for authentication.
- **Size**: 1212 characters
- **Usage**: Ensures that user input meets the required criteria for authentication.

### auth.py
- **Role**: Manages the authentication process for users.
- **Size**: 2198 characters
- **Usage**: Handles user login, registration, and authentication logic.

## Usage
1. To use the input validation functionality, refer to `validator.js`. Ensure that the input data is validated before proceeding with authentication processes.
2. For user authentication operations such as login and registration, utilize the functions provided in `auth.py`. This file contains the necessary logic to authenticate users within the system.
