- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters responsible for validating user input data.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters that manage user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file is crucial for validating user input data to ensure it meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is essential for handling user authentication processes, such as login, registration, and session management.

## Usage
1. To use the `validator.js` file, import it into your JavaScript code and call its functions to validate user input data.
2. For the `auth.py` file, import it into your Python code and utilize its functions for user authentication tasks like login and registration.

Ensure to follow the documentation within each file for specific usage instructions and function details.
