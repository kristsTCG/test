# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes a JavaScript file for validation (`validator.js`) and a Python file for authentication (`auth.py`).

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input, ensuring data integrity and security.
- `auth.py`: The Python file handles user authentication processes, such as login, registration, and session management.

## Usage
1. To use the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code and call the appropriate functions to validate user input.
2. For user authentication tasks, import `auth.py` into your Python code. Use the functions provided to manage user login, registration, and sessions securely.
