# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` for client-side input validation in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication logic in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This file is responsible for client-side input validation. It contains functions to validate user input before submitting it to the server. It helps ensure that the data entered by users meets the required criteria.
   
2. **auth.py**: This file handles server-side authentication processes. It includes functions for user login, registration, and authentication. It interacts with the database to verify user credentials and manage user sessions.

## Usage
1. To use the client-side input validation, refer to the `validator.js` file. You can customize the validation rules according to your project requirements by modifying the functions in this file.
   
2. For server-side authentication tasks, utilize the functions provided in the `auth.py` file. This includes implementing user login, registration, and authentication logic. Ensure proper integration with your database for storing and retrieving user information.
