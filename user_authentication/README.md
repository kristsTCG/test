# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It includes a JavaScript file for validation and a Python file for handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files, `validator.js` for client-side validation and `auth.py` for server-side authentication.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user data is correctly formatted before submission.
   
2. **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for server-side authentication processes. It manages user authentication, login, and logout functionalities within the project.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed for different input fields.
   - Include `validator.js` in your HTML files using `<script src="path/to/validator.js"></script>`.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Integrate the authentication logic into your server-side codebase.
   - Use the functions provided in `auth.py` for user login and logout operations.

Ensure that both client-side and server-side authentication processes are in sync to provide a secure and seamless user experience.
