# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles tasks such as user validation and authentication.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate the validation logic in `validator.js` written in JavaScript and the authentication logic in `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This file contains the user validation logic implemented in JavaScript. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user input meets the required criteria for authentication.
- `auth.py`: The `auth.py` file contains the authentication logic written in Python. It manages user authentication processes and interactions with the authentication system.

## Usage
1. To utilize the user validation functionality, refer to the `validator.js` file. Ensure to understand the validation criteria and integrate it with user input forms.
2. For user authentication processes, refer to the `auth.py` file. Implement the necessary authentication methods and integrate them into the project's authentication flow.
