# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle validation and authentication processes for user accounts.

## Structure
The folder consists of two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file containing functions for validating user input.
- `auth.py`: A Python file responsible for handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- Role: This file contains functions to validate user input such as email addresses, passwords, and other user-related data.
- Size: 1212 characters

### auth.py
- Role: This file manages user authentication processes, including login, registration, and password reset functionalities.
- Size: 2198 characters

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the necessary functions into your JavaScript files and call them as needed for input validation.
2. For user authentication processes, import and utilize the functions provided in `auth.py` within your Python codebase to handle user login, registration, and password reset functionalities.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength and format of a password, requiring at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and a number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username, allowing 3-20 characters that are alphanumeric and underscores only.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types, returning a descriptive strength level.

**Usage:** This file can be imported into other JavaScript files using `require` or `import` statements, and the functions can be called with the respective input values for validation.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by deleting the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: For handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
