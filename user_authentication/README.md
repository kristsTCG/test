# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling the authentication process. It includes functions for user login, registration, and authentication logic.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review `validator.js` to understand the validation rules for user input.
2. Explore `auth.py` to familiarize yourself with the authentication logic and functions.
3. Modify or extend the existing code to suit the specific requirements of the project.
4. Ensure that any changes made adhere to the existing validation rules and authentication processes.
