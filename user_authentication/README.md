### 🏗️ Technical Architecture  
**System Design:**
- This file follows a modular design pattern, encapsulating input validation functions within a class structure for reusability and maintainability.
- Design principles such as separation of concerns and single responsibility are applied to ensure clean and organized code.
- The file relies on core JavaScript functionality and regular expressions for input validation, with no external dependencies.
- It integrates seamlessly with user authentication systems by providing a standalone validation module that can be easily incorporated into existing codebases.

**Data Architecture:**
- No specific data models are used in this file; it focuses on validating user input rather than interacting with complex data structures.
- Database interactions are not performed by this code; it solely focuses on input validation logic.
- Data validation rules are defined within the regular expressions used in the validation functions.
- Input/output specifications involve passing user-provided data to the validation functions and receiving a boolean result indicating whether the input is valid.

**Performance & Scalability:**
- The performance of this code is efficient as it relies on regular expressions for fast pattern matching.
- Scalability considerations involve the ability to handle a large number of validation requests concurrently without impacting performance significantly.
- Resource usage is minimal, with low memory and CPU requirements due to the lightweight nature of the validation functions.
- Optimization strategies include using optimized regular expressions for efficient input validation.
