# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes a JavaScript file for validation (`validator.js`) and a Python file for authentication (`auth.py`).

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input, ensuring data integrity before proceeding with authentication processes.
- `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication logic, such as verifying user credentials and managing user sessions.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code and call the appropriate validation functions as needed.
2. For user authentication tasks, import `auth.py` into your Python code and utilize the provided functions for authenticating users and managing sessions.
