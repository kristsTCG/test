# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities in the project. This includes validation of user inputs and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized with two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python. These files handle user input validation and user authentication logic respectively.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: Responsible for validating user inputs.
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Language: JavaScript

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Manages user authentication processes.
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Language: Python

## Usage
1. **validator.js**
   - To use the validator, import the `validator.js` file in your JavaScript code.
   - Call the appropriate validation functions provided in the file to validate user inputs.

2. **auth.py**
   - Import the `auth.py` file in your Python project to utilize the authentication functionalities.
   - Use the functions defined in `auth.py` to handle user authentication processes.

Ensure to follow the documentation within each file for specific usage instructions and function details.
