# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It helps ensure that user data meets the required criteria before sending it to the server for authentication.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file handles server-side authentication logic. It manages user authentication, including verifying user credentials and generating access tokens.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to match the project's requirements.
   - Include the script in your HTML file using `<script src="path/to/validator.js"></script>`.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Implement additional authentication methods or customize the existing logic to suit your project.
   - Integrate the authentication functionality with other parts of the project by importing `auth.py` where needed.
