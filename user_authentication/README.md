# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It is responsible for validating user inputs and handling user authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user inputs and ensuring data integrity during the authentication process. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the security and accuracy of user information.
  
- `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling the authentication logic, such as user login, registration, and session management. It interacts with the database and other components to authenticate users securely.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in the `user_authentication` folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules and functions available for user inputs.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to grasp the authentication logic and methods for user login, registration, and session management.
3. Integrate the validation and authentication functionalities into your project by importing and utilizing the necessary functions from these files.

Ensure to adhere to the coding standards and security practices while working with the code in this folder to maintain the integrity of user authentication processes.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is between 3 to 20 characters long, and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on its length and character composition.

**Usage:** To use this file, import it into your JavaScript code using `const InputValidator = require('./validator.js');` or ES6 import syntax.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token if successful.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the provided session token.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid and the user is authenticated.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: Used for hashing passwords.
- `json`: Used for JSON serialization.
