# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It includes a JavaScript file for validation and a Python file for handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files, `validator.js` for client-side validation and `auth.py` for server-side authentication.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation logic for user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria before submission.
  
- `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for server-side authentication processes. It manages user authentication, login, and session handling within the application.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in the `user_authentication` folder:
1. Modify the validation rules in `validator.js` to suit the project's requirements.
2. Implement the authentication logic in `auth.py` to secure user access to the application.
3. Ensure proper integration of these files with other components that require user authentication within the project.
