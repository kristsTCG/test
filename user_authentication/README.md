# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder consists of two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file containing 1212 characters, responsible for validating user input data.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters, handling user authentication and authorization.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file is crucial for ensuring that user input data meets the required criteria and is safe for processing within the system.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file plays a vital role in authenticating users and managing their access to the system. It handles user login, registration, and authorization processes.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review `validator.js` to understand the validation logic and criteria for user input data.
2. Explore `auth.py` to grasp the user authentication and authorization mechanisms implemented in the project.
3. Make necessary modifications or enhancements to these files to customize user authentication processes as per project requirements.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates an email address based on a regular expression pattern.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates a password based on specific criteria (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates a username based on length and character restrictions.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character complexity.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class in your code and call the validation methods as needed.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token for active sessions.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by removing the session token from active sessions.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations like registration, login, logout, and session validation.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in the provided code snippet).
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
