# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for handling authentication processes.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input, ensuring data integrity and security.
- **auth.py**: Responsible for managing user authentication, including login, registration, and session management.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code and call the necessary functions to validate user input.
2. For user authentication tasks, import `auth.py` into your Python code and use the provided functions for user login, registration, and session management.

- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on various criteria.

**Usage:** This file can be imported into other JavaScript files using `require` or `import` statements, and the provided functions can be called with the respective input values to perform validation.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies and can be used independently for input validation purposes.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication, registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash passwords using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
