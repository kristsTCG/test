# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains the following key components:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters responsible for validating user input.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters that implement the authentication logic.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file handles the validation of user input to ensure data integrity and security. It plays a crucial role in preventing malicious input and ensuring that only valid data is processed.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file contains the authentication logic for verifying user credentials and managing user sessions. It is essential for secure user authentication within the project.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review `validator.js` to understand the validation rules applied to user input.
2. Examine `auth.py` to understand how user authentication is implemented in the project.
3. Make necessary modifications or enhancements to the validation and authentication logic as per project requirements.
4. Ensure that any changes made adhere to security best practices to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.
