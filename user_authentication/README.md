# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It includes files responsible for validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python, each serving specific purposes in the authentication workflow.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This file contains JavaScript code (1212 characters) for validating user input related to authentication. It ensures that user-provided data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.

2. **auth.py**: This Python file (2198 characters) manages the authentication logic within the project. It handles user login, registration, and other authentication-related tasks. 

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules applied to user input.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to grasp the authentication logic and functionalities implemented in Python.
3. Modify or extend the code as needed to customize the user authentication process for your project.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and a number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is between 3-20 characters long and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the provided validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies required for this file.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication system.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `typing`: For type hints.
