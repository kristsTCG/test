# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
- `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication logic. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
1. Review the code in `validator.js` to understand the validation logic implemented for user input.
2. Examine `auth.py` to understand how user authentication processes are managed within the project.
3. Integrate these files into the project's authentication system as needed, ensuring proper error handling and security measures are in place.
