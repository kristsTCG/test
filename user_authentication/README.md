# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side validation in JavaScript and auth.py for server-side authentication in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It helps ensure that user-provided data meets specified criteria before submission.
- **auth.py**: The auth.py file is responsible for server-side authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication against the system.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to suit the project requirements.
   - Include the validator.js file in your HTML pages to enable client-side validation.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Implement additional authentication logic as required by the project.
   - Integrate the auth.py file with your backend system to handle user authentication tasks.
