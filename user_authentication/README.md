# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side validation and auth.py for server-side authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation logic for user input data. It ensures that user inputs meet the required criteria before submitting them for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python file is responsible for server-side authentication. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes securely on the server side.

## Usage
1. Use `validator.js` to implement client-side validation for user inputs. Include this file in your HTML pages to validate user data before submitting it to the server.
   
2. Utilize `auth.py` for server-side authentication tasks. Integrate this file with your backend server to handle user login, registration, and authentication securely.

3. Ensure that both client-side and server-side validation processes work seamlessly together to provide a secure and user-friendly authentication experience.
