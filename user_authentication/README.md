# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
- `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling the authentication process. It manages user login, registration, and authentication logic within the system.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided by the `user_authentication` folder, developers can refer to the following guidelines:
1. Use the functions defined in `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing it for authentication.
2. Incorporate the authentication logic implemented in `auth.py` to manage user login, registration, and authentication processes effectively.
3. Ensure that the code in these files is integrated seamlessly with other components of the project that require user authentication functionalities.

- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character requirements.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class in your code and call the necessary validation methods.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.

- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and not expired.

**Usage:** Import the `UserAuth` class from this file to handle user authentication in your Python application.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating expiration time of session tokens.
