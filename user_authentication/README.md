# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Language: JavaScript
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Role: Responsible for validating user input data and ensuring it meets the required criteria for authentication.

2. **auth.py**
   - Language: Python
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Role: Manages the authentication process, including verifying user credentials and granting access based on authentication status.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in the `user_authentication` folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation criteria for user input data.
2. Examine the `auth.py` file to grasp the authentication process and how user credentials are verified.
3. Integrate these files into your project to enable user authentication features securely.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is 3-20 characters long, alphanumeric, and contains underscores only.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength level of a given password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session by invalidating the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and not expired.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations like registration, login, session handling, and authentication.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: Used for hashing passwords.
- `json`: Not used in this file but imported.
- `datetime`: Used for handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: Used for calculating expiration time for session tokens.
