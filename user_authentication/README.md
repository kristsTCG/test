# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes files responsible for validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input related to authentication. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file is 2198 characters long and handles the authentication processes for users. It manages user login, registration, and authentication logic within the project.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
- Use `validator.js` for validating user input related to authentication.
- Utilize `auth.py` for handling user authentication processes such as login, registration, and authentication logic.

Ensure that any modifications or additions to these files follow the project's authentication guidelines and security protocols.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** This file can be imported into other JavaScript files using `require` or `import` statements to access the input validation functionalities provided by the `InputValidator` class.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies and can be used independently for input validation tasks in user authentication scenarios.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user authentication, registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session by removing the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication. Use the provided methods to register users, log in, log out, and check authentication status.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: For date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For time duration calculations.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
