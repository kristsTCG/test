# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user inputs and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user inputs such as email addresses, passwords, and other user-related data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring data integrity and security.
  
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It includes functions for user login, registration, and authentication checks. This file is essential for managing user access to the system securely.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
1. Use the functions defined in `validator.js` to validate user inputs before processing them.
2. Incorporate the functions from `auth.py` to manage user authentication processes within the project.
3. Ensure proper integration of these files with other components of the project that require user authentication capabilities.
