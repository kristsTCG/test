# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate the validation logic in `validator.js` written in JavaScript and the authentication logic in `auth.py` written in Python. This separation allows for clear and modular handling of user authentication tasks.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains the validation logic for user inputs. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It verifies user credentials and grants access based on the authentication results.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation logic, refer to `validator.js` and incorporate the necessary validation checks in your user input forms or data processing scripts.

2. For user authentication tasks, interact with `auth.py` to authenticate users based on their credentials. You can integrate this file into your authentication flow to ensure secure access control.

3. Ensure that any modifications or additions to these files align with the project's user authentication requirements and security standards.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates an email address based on a regular expression pattern.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates a password based on specific criteria (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates a username based on length and allowed characters.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token for active sessions.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by removing the session token from active sessions.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and not expired.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: Used for hashing passwords.
- `json`: Not used in the provided code but imported.
- `datetime`: Used for handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: Used for calculating expiration time for session tokens.
- `typing`: Used for type hinting in function definitions.
