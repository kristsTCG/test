# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files, `validator.js` and `auth.py`, which are responsible for validating user input and handling authentication logic, respectively.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file consists of 1212 characters and is crucial for validating user input data. It ensures that user-provided information meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.

2. `auth.py`: This Python file contains 2198 characters and plays a significant role in authenticating users. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation criteria for user input data.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to grasp the authentication logic and processes implemented for user management.
3. Integrate the functions and methods from these files into your project as needed to enable secure user authentication mechanisms.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file contains input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric characters and underscores within a specific length range.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Register a new user with a unique username.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticate user and return a session token.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: End a user session based on the session token.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Check if a session token is valid and the user is authenticated.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to manage user authentication operations. Call `register_user` to add a new user, `login` to authenticate and get a session token, `logout` to end a session, and `is_authenticated` to check session validity.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For working with JSON data.
- `datetime`: For managing date and time information.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing.Optional`, `typing.Dict`: For type hints.
