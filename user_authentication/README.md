# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This functionality is responsible for validating user input and managing user authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for managing user authentication processes. It handles tasks such as user login, registration, and authentication verification.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
- Use `validator.js` functions to validate user input data before processing it for authentication.
- Utilize `auth.py` for managing user authentication processes, including login, registration, and authentication verification.
- Ensure to integrate these files with other parts of the project that require user authentication functionality.
