# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` for client-side input validation written in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication logic written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: Responsible for client-side input validation.
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Language: JavaScript

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Manages server-side authentication processes.
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Language: Python

## Usage
1. **validator.js**
   - Ensure the `validator.js` file is included in your HTML file using a script tag.
   - Use the provided validation functions to validate user input on the client side before submitting forms.

2. **auth.py**
   - Import the `auth.py` module in your Python server-side code.
   - Utilize the authentication functions provided to handle user login, registration, and authentication processes.

Remember to maintain the integrity of user authentication by following best practices and keeping sensitive information secure.

- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates a username based on length and character restrictions.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Evaluates the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class from `validator.js` and call the desired validation functions or password strength evaluation function.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that handles user authentication operations.
