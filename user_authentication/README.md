# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` for client-side validation written in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic for user inputs. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submission.
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file handles server-side authentication processes. It manages user authentication, login, and access control within the application.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to match the project requirements.
   - Integrate the validation logic with user input forms in the frontend.
   
2. **auth.py**:
   - Configure authentication settings such as session management and password hashing.
   - Implement additional security measures like two-factor authentication if required.
   - Integrate the authentication functionality with the backend services that require user authentication.

Ensure that both client-side and server-side validation work seamlessly together to provide a secure and user-friendly authentication experience for the application users.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the provided validation functions.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `typing`: For type hints.
