# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder consists of two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python. These files handle user input validation and authentication logic respectively.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input such as email addresses, passwords, and other user credentials. It plays a crucial role in ensuring data integrity and security.
  
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It includes functions for user login, registration, and authentication using various methods like tokens or sessions.

## Usage
1. To use the validation functions provided in `validator.js`, import the necessary functions into your JavaScript files and call them as needed to validate user input.
   
   Example:
   ```javascript
   import { validateEmail, validatePassword } from './validator.js';

   if (validateEmail(email)) {
       // Email is valid
   } else {
       // Email is invalid
   }
   ```

2. In Python scripts, import the authentication functions from `auth.py` to implement user authentication features such as login and registration.
   
   Example:
   ```python
   from auth import login, register

   user_credentials = {
       'username': 'example_user',
       'password': 'secure_password'
   }

   if login(user_credentials):
       # User authenticated successfully
   else:
       # Authentication failed
   ```

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength level of a password based on various criteria.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class in your code and call the validation methods as needed.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
