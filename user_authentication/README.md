# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This module handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side validation and auth.py for server-side authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation logic for user inputs. It ensures that user data is correctly formatted before submission.
- **auth.py**: The Python file auth.py manages server-side authentication processes. It handles user login, registration, and authentication against the database.

## Usage
1. To use the client-side validation provided by `validator.js`, include the script in your HTML file using `<script src="path/to/validator.js"></script>`. Then, call the validation functions as needed in your front-end code.
2. For server-side authentication, import the `auth.py` module in your Python application. Utilize the functions within this file to handle user login, registration, and authentication processes.
