# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input data related to authentication. It ensures that the input meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python file is 2198 characters long and handles the authentication logic for users. It manages the authentication process, including verifying user credentials and granting access based on authentication rules.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review `validator.js` to understand the validation rules for user input data.
2. Explore `auth.py` to understand the authentication logic and flow within the project.
3. Make necessary modifications or enhancements to the authentication process by editing these files as needed.
4. Ensure that any changes made adhere to the project's authentication requirements and security standards.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and a number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is between 3-20 characters long and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character complexity.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the provided validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token for active sessions.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by removing the session token from active sessions.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** This file can be imported into other Python scripts to handle user authentication tasks.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: Used for hashing passwords.
- `json`: Not directly used in this file but imported.
- `datetime`: Used for date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: Used for calculating expiration time for session tokens.
- `typing`: Used for type hints in function definitions.
