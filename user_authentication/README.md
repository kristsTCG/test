# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
- `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication tasks within the project.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Use the functions defined in `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing it further.
2. Utilize the functionalities provided in `auth.py` for user authentication tasks such as login, registration, and authentication processes.

Ensure to follow the coding standards and guidelines set for the project while working with the code in this folder.
