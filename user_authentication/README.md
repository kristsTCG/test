## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Language: JavaScript
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Description: This file handles the validation of user input for authentication purposes. It ensures that the data provided by the user meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.

2. **auth.py**

   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Description: This file contains the authentication logic for verifying user credentials and granting access to the system. It manages the authentication process and interacts with the database to validate user information.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**
   - To use the `validator.js` file, import it into your JavaScript code using `require` or `import` statements.
   - Utilize the functions provided in `validator.js` to validate user input data before proceeding with authentication.
   - Customize the validation criteria as needed for your project requirements.

2. **auth.py**
   - Incorporate the `auth.py` file into your Python project by importing it using `import auth`.
