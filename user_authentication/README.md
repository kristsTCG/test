# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input data related to authentication. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file is 2198 characters long and handles the authentication logic for users. It verifies user credentials and manages the authentication process within the project.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
- Use `validator.js` for validating user input data before proceeding with authentication processes.
- Utilize `auth.py` for handling user authentication logic and verifying user credentials.
- Ensure that any modifications or additions to these files align with the overall user authentication requirements of the project.
