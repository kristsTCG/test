# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate the validation logic implemented in JavaScript and the authentication logic implemented in Python. This separation allows for modularity and easier maintenance of the authentication system.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains the user validation logic, ensuring that user input meets specified criteria before proceeding with authentication.
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes, such as verifying user credentials and granting access to authorized users.

## Usage
1. To work with the user validation logic, refer to `validator.js`. Modify the validation criteria as needed to suit the project requirements.
2. For user authentication tasks, utilize `auth.py`. Implement additional authentication methods or customize the authentication process as required.
3. Ensure to maintain the separation of concerns between validation and authentication logic to uphold code clarity and organization.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates a password based on length and character requirements.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates a username for length and character constraints.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on various criteria.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class in your code:
```javascript
const InputValidator = require('./validator.js');
```

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session based on the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and the user is authenticated.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication functionalities.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints (not used in this file).
