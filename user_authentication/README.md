# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submission.
- **auth.py**: This Python file handles server-side authentication processes. It manages user authentication, login, and authorization within the system.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to match the project's requirements.
   - Include the script in your HTML files using `<script src="path/to/validator.js"></script>`.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Integrate the authentication logic into your server-side codebase.
   - Use the functions provided in `auth.py` for user authentication and authorization.
   - Ensure proper error handling and security measures are in place to protect user data.

By following the guidelines above, you can effectively utilize the user authentication functionality provided in this folder.
