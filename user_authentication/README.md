# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling the authentication process. It manages user login, registration, and authentication logic within the system.

## Usage
Developers can utilize the `validator.js` file to implement input validation for user authentication forms. The `auth.py` file can be used to integrate user authentication features into the project, such as login and registration functionalities. Ensure to follow the code structure and guidelines within each file for seamless integration and functionality.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file contains input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and a number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is 3-20 characters long and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of the input password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** This file can be imported as a module in other JavaScript files to perform input validation for user authentication.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token for active sessions.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by removing the session token from active sessions.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided by this file.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib` for hashing functions.
- `json` for JSON encoding/decoding.
- `datetime` for date and time operations.
- `timedelta` from `datetime` for time-based calculations.
- `typing.Optional` and `typing.Dict` for type hints.
