# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles tasks such as validating user input and managing user authentication using JavaScript and Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate the validation logic in `validator.js` written in JavaScript and the authentication functionality in `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This file contains the validation logic for user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
- `auth.py`: The `auth.py` file is responsible for managing user authentication using Python. It handles tasks such as user login, registration, and authentication processes.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review `validator.js` to understand the validation rules applied to user input.
2. Explore `auth.py` to understand how user authentication is implemented using Python.
3. Modify the validation rules in `validator.js` as needed to customize input validation.
4. Update the authentication logic in `auth.py` to align with the project's specific requirements.
5. Ensure that any changes made adhere to security best practices to protect user data.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username, allowing alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password and returns a descriptive level.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class in your code and call the desired validation methods as needed.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the session token.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to manage user registration, login, and session handling.

**Dependencies:** `hashlib`, `json`, `datetime`, `timedelta`, `typing`.
