# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` for client-side validation written in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This file contains client-side validation logic with 1212 characters. It is responsible for validating user input on the client side before submitting it to the server.
   
2. `auth.py`: This file contains server-side authentication logic with 2198 characters. It handles user authentication requests and verifies user credentials on the server side.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionality in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Use the `validator.js` file to implement client-side validation for user input forms.
2. Incorporate the `auth.py` file to handle user authentication requests and verify user credentials on the server side.
3. Ensure that both client-side and server-side authentication processes are synchronized to provide a secure and seamless user authentication experience.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username inputs, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric characters and underscores within a specific length range.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on various criteria and returns a descriptive level.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the provided validation methods in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by invalidating the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and not expired.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints (not used in this file).
