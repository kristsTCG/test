# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes validation logic in JavaScript and authentication logic in Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks. It contains two key files: `validator.js` for input validation and `auth.py` for user authentication.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains logic for validating user inputs. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
  
- `auth.py`: This Python file handles user authentication processes. It is responsible for validating user credentials, generating tokens, and managing user sessions.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation logic, refer to `validator.js` and incorporate the validation functions into your user input processing workflows.
   
2. For user authentication tasks, interact with `auth.py` to authenticate users, manage sessions, and handle token generation and verification.

3. Ensure to follow the guidelines and best practices outlined in each file for secure and efficient user authentication processes.
