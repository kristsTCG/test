# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input data for authentication purposes.
- **auth.py**: This Python file contains 2198 characters and handles the authentication logic for users.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionality in the project:
1. Review the `validator.js` file for user input validation rules.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to understand the authentication process and integrate it with other parts of the project.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric and underscore characters.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password and returns a descriptive level.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and hashed password.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token if successful.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the provided session token.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Import the `UserAuth` class from this file to handle user authentication in your Python application.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For handling JSON data.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing.Optional`: For defining optional return types.
- `typing.Dict`: For defining dictionary types.
