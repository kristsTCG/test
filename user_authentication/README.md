# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user inputs and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Language: JavaScript
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Role: Responsible for validating user inputs such as email addresses, passwords, and other user-related data. Ensures data integrity and security in the authentication process.

2. **auth.py**
   - Language: Python
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Role: Manages the authentication logic, including user login, registration, and session management. Implements secure authentication mechanisms to protect user data.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality, refer to `validator.js`. Modify or extend the validation rules as needed for different user input fields.
   
2. For authentication tasks, interact with `auth.py`. Implement user registration, login, and session handling based on the project requirements. Ensure to follow secure coding practices to protect user data.
