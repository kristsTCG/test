# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input data related to authentication. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python file is 2198 characters long and handles the authentication logic for users. It manages the process of verifying user credentials and granting access to authorized users.

## Usage
To utilize the code in this folder effectively, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules for user input data.
2. Examine the `auth.py` file to understand the authentication process and how user credentials are verified.
3. Integrate the validation and authentication logic into your project as needed.
4. Test the user authentication functionality thoroughly to ensure it works as expected and provides a secure authentication process.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength evaluation.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is 3-20 characters long, alphanumeric, and contains underscores only.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Evaluates the strength of a password based on length and character complexity.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Method to register a new user.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Method to authenticate a user and return a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Method to end a user session.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Method to check if a session is valid.

**Usage:** This file can be imported to handle user authentication in Python applications.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
