# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. It includes scripts for validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data.
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Usage: Used to ensure that user-provided data meets the required criteria before processing.

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: The Python script `auth.py` manages user authentication processes such as login, registration, and password management.
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Usage: Responsible for handling user authentication tasks securely and efficiently.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**
   - To use the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code.
   - Call the appropriate validation functions on user input data to ensure its correctness before further processing.

2. **auth.py**
   - Import `auth.py` into your Python code to utilize the authentication functionalities.
   - Use the provided functions in `auth.py` to implement user registration, login, and password management features in your application.

Ensure that you follow the guidelines and best practices defined in these files to maintain secure user authentication processes in your project.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates and returns the strength level of a password.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class in your code. For example:
```javascript
const InputValidator = require('./validator.js');
```

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session management, and authentication.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Method to register a new user.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Method to authenticate a user and return a session token.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Method to end a user session.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to manage user authentication. Call `register_user` to add new users, `login` to authenticate users and get session tokens, `logout` to end sessions, and `is_authenticated` to check session validity.

**Dependencies:** `hashlib`, `json`, `datetime`, `timedelta`, `Optional`, `Dict`
