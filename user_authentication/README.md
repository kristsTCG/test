# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` for client-side input validation written in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication logic written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input on the client-side. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submission.
  
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is responsible for handling server-side authentication processes. It manages user authentication, login, and authorization within the application.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - To use the validation functions in `validator.js`, include the file in your HTML document using a script tag.
   - Call the appropriate validation functions on user input fields to ensure data integrity.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Import `auth.py` in your Python application to access the authentication functionalities.
   - Utilize the provided functions for user authentication, login, and authorization processes as needed.

Ensure that you follow the specific usage instructions within each file to integrate user authentication features seamlessly into your project.
