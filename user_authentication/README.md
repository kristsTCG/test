# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. This module handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Language: JavaScript
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Role: Responsible for validating user input data and ensuring data integrity during the authentication process.

2. **auth.py**
   - Language: Python
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Role: Manages the authentication logic, including user login, registration, and session management.

## Usage
1. To utilize the functionalities provided by the `validator.js` file, import it into your JavaScript code using `import validator from './validator.js'`. You can then call the validation functions as needed in your authentication processes.

2. For the Python authentication logic in `auth.py`, ensure it is properly integrated into your Python project. You can import the necessary functions from `auth.py` using `from auth import login, register, manage_session`. Use these functions to handle user authentication tasks within your application.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is 3-20 characters long, alphanumeric, and allows underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character complexity.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password()`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user()`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login()`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout()`: Method to end a user's session using their session token.
- `is_authenticated()`: Method to check if a session token is valid and the user is authenticated.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to use the provided authentication functionalities.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hinting.
