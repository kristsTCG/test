# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This module is responsible for validating user input and handling user authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` consists of two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters, responsible for validating user input data.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters, responsible for handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file contains functions for validating user input data to ensure it meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.

### auth.py
This file contains functions for user authentication, such as login, logout, and user session management. It handles the authentication flow and interacts with the database to verify user credentials.

## Usage
1. To work with the validation functionality, refer to `validator.js`. You can call the validation functions provided in this file to validate user input data before processing it further.

2. For user authentication processes, refer to `auth.py`. Use the functions defined in this file to handle user login, logout, and session management within the application.

3. Ensure to integrate these files into the relevant parts of the project where user authentication is required, following the established authentication flow and validation procedures.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class in your code and call the desired validation functions as needed.

```javascript
const InputValidator = require('./validator.js');

if (InputValidator.validateEmail('example@email.com')) {
    console.log('Email is valid');
}

if (InputValidator.validatePassword('StrongPass123')) {
    console.log('Password meets criteria');
}

if (InputValidator.validateUsername('user_name123')) {
    console.log('Username is valid');
}

const passwordStrength = InputValidator.getPasswordStrength('SecurePass123');
console.log('Password strength: ', passwordStrength);
```

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to manage user registration, login, logout, and session validation.

**Dependencies:** `hashlib`, `json`, `datetime`, `timedelta`, `typing`.
