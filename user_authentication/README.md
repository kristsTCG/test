# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python file handles the authentication logic for users. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the system.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions provided in `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code and call the necessary functions to validate user input data.

2. For user authentication functionalities, import `auth.py` into your Python code. Use the functions defined within this file to handle user login, registration, and authentication processes effectively.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username allowing alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on various criteria and returns a level of strength.

**Usage:** This file can be imported into other JavaScript files using `require` or `import` statements to access the input validation functionalities provided by the `InputValidator` class.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes the password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and hashed password.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the session token.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** To use this file, create an instance of `UserAuth` and call its methods for user registration, login, logout, and session validation.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
