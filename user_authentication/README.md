# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python. These files handle user input validation and user authentication respectively.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions to validate user input such as email addresses, passwords, and other form data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring data integrity and security.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file is responsible for handling user authentication processes such as login, logout, and session management. It interacts with the database to authenticate users and authorize access to protected resources.

## Usage
1. To use the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the necessary functions into your JavaScript files and call them with the appropriate input data.
   
2. For user authentication functionalities provided in `auth.py`, import the module into your Python scripts and utilize the exposed methods for user login, logout, and session management.

Ensure that you follow the defined input requirements and security measures when integrating these components into your project.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file contains input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username allowing only alphanumeric characters and underscores within a specific length range.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character requirements.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication process.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token for active sessions.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the provided session token.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** To use this file, create an instance of the `UserAuth` class and call its methods for user registration, login, logout, and session validation.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
