# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side input validation and auth.py for server-side authentication logic.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation functions to ensure that user input meets specified criteria before submission.
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for server-side authentication processes, such as verifying user credentials and managing user sessions.

## Usage
1. Use `validator.js` to implement client-side input validation by including the necessary functions in your frontend code.
2. Utilize `auth.py` to handle server-side authentication tasks, such as verifying user credentials and managing user sessions within your backend application.

Ensure to maintain the integrity and security of user authentication processes by following best practices and regularly updating the authentication mechanisms in this folder.
