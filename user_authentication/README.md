# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Type: JavaScript
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Role: This file is responsible for validating user input data, ensuring that the input meets specified criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.

2. **auth.py**
   - Type: Python
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Role: The `auth.py` file handles the actual authentication logic, verifying user credentials and granting access to authorized users.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality, refer to `validator.js` for the specific validation criteria and integrate it into your user input forms.
   
2. For user authentication processes, interact with the functions and methods defined in `auth.py` to authenticate users and manage access control within the project.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username inputs, as well as determining the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on various criteria.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class managing user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Register a new user with a unique username.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticate a user and return a session token.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: End a user session by invalidating the session token.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication. Call `register_user` to add a new user, `login` to authenticate and get a session token, `logout` to end a session, and `is_authenticated` to check session validity.

**Dependencies:** `hashlib`, `json`, `datetime`, `timedelta`, `typing`.
