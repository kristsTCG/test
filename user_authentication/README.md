# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submission.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file handles server-side authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication using secure methods.

## Usage
1. To utilize the client-side validation functionality, refer to `validator.js` and integrate the validation logic into your frontend code.
   
2. For server-side authentication tasks, utilize the functions and methods provided in `auth.py`. This includes handling user login requests, registration processes, and verifying user credentials securely.

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username inputs, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric and underscore characters.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on various criteria.

**Usage:** This file can be imported as a module in other JavaScript files to perform input validation tasks.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies are required for this file.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** User authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class managing user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates user and returns session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends user session.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if session is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: For date and time operations.
- `typing`: For type hints.
