# Files Documentation

## validator.js

### 📊 Business Context & Impact
**Business Problem Statement:**
- This code provides input validation utilities for user authentication, ensuring that email addresses, passwords, and usernames meet specific criteria.
- It helps prevent invalid data from being processed, enhancing security and user experience.
- The organization benefits from improved data integrity and reduced risk of security breaches.

**Stakeholder Analysis:**
- Primary users include developers implementing user authentication systems and administrators managing user accounts.
- Secondary stakeholders such as security teams benefit from strengthened authentication processes.
- Integrates with user management, authentication, and security processes within the organization.

### 🏗️ Technical Architecture
**System Design:**
- Utilizes a class-based design pattern for encapsulating validation logic.
- Relies on regular expressions for pattern matching.
- Can be integrated into Node.js applications using `module.exports`.

**Data Architecture:**
- No direct data storage or interaction, focused on input validation only.
- Ensures data integrity by enforcing specific format requirements for user inputs.
- Validates user input against predefined rules to maintain data quality.

**Performance & Scalability:**
- Performance is efficient due to the use of regex for validation.
- Scalable as it can handle a large number of validation requests concurrently.
- Optimization strategies include caching regex patterns for reuse.

### 💻 Code Implementation Details
**Function/Class Documentation:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets complexity requirements.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username follows specified rules.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on complexity.

**Code Examples & Usage:**
- Example:
  ```javascript
  const InputValidator = require('./validator.js');
  console.log(InputValidator.validateEmail('test@example.com')); // true
  console.log(InputValidator.validatePassword('Password123')); // true
  console.log(InputValidator.validateUsername('user_123')); // true
  console.log(InputValidator.getPasswordStrength('P@ssw0rd')); // 'Good'
  ```

**Security & Compliance:**
- Implements password complexity requirements to enhance security.
- Ensures that user input adheres to specific formats to prevent injection attacks.
- Supports compliance with data protection regulations by validating user input.

### 🔧 Operations & Maintenance
**Deployment Considerations:**
- Requires Node.js environment for execution

## auth.py

### 📊 Business Context & Impact
**Business Problem Statement:**
- This code provides a user authentication system with login and registration functionality, addressing the need for secure user access control.
- It helps in managing user accounts, ensuring only registered users can access specific resources.
- The organization benefits from improved security and user management processes.

**Stakeholder Analysis:**
- Primary users include administrators, developers, and end-users who interact with the authentication system.
- Secondary stakeholders such as security officers and compliance teams benefit from enhanced security measures.
- Integrates with business processes requiring user authentication for access control and data protection.

### 🏗️ Technical Architecture
**System Design:**
- Follows a modular design pattern with separate functions for registration, login, and session management.
- Uses Python standard libraries for hashing, datetime operations, and session management.
- No external dependencies for basic functionality.

**Data Architecture:**
- Stores user data in-memory using dictionaries for users and active sessions.
- Utilizes datetime for timestamp management.
- No database interactions for simplicity in this implementation.
- Validates data during registration and session validation.

**Performance & Scalability:**
- Performance is dependent on the size of the active user base and session management.
- Scalability considerations include potential bottlenecks with large user bases and session handling.
- Optimization strategies may involve caching mechanisms for faster user lookup.

### 💻 Code Implementation Details
**Function/Class Documentation:**
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes the password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with unique username.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates user and generates a session token.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends the user session.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if the session is valid.

**Code Examples & Usage:**
```python
auth = UserAuth()
auth.register_user('user1', 'user1@example.com', 'password123')
session_token = auth.login('user1', 'password123')
if session_token:
    print("User authenticated. Session token:", session_token)
```

**Security & Compliance:**
- Passwords are securely hashed before storage.
- Session tokens are generated securely.
- Compliance requirements for user authentication and data protection are addressed.
