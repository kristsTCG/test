# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This file contains the logic for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that the data provided by users meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file handles the authentication process for users. It includes functions for user login, registration, and authentication checks.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
- Use the `validator.js` file to validate user input before processing authentication requests.
- Utilize the functions in `auth.py` to manage user authentication tasks such as login, registration, and authentication checks.

Ensure that the code in these files is integrated correctly with other parts of the project that require user authentication.

- `logout`: Method to end a user's session by invalidating the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and not expired.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib` for hashing functions.
