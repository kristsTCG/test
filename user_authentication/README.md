# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input data related to authentication. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file is 2198 characters long and handles the authentication logic for users. It verifies user credentials and manages user authentication processes.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review `validator.js` to understand the validation rules for user input data.
2. Examine `auth.py` to understand how user authentication is implemented in the project.
3. Make necessary modifications to these files to customize user authentication processes as needed.

- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** This file can be imported into other JavaScript files using `require` or `import` statements to access the input validation functionalities provided by the `InputValidator` class.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
