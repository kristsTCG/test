# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. It includes scripts for validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input, ensuring data integrity, and preventing malicious input.
   - Size: 1212 characters

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: The Python script `auth.py` manages user authentication processes, such as login, registration, and session management.
   - Size: 2198 characters

## Usage
1. **validator.js**
   - To use the functions in `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code using `import { functionName } from './validator.js';`.
   - Call the necessary validation functions passing user input as arguments to ensure data integrity.

2. **auth.py**
   - Import `auth.py` into your Python code using `from auth import function_name`.
   - Utilize the authentication functions provided in `auth.py` for user registration, login, and session management within your application.

Ensure to follow the coding standards and guidelines set within the project for consistency and maintainability.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username inputs, as well as determining the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numeric characters.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username, allowing only alphanumeric characters and underscores within a specific length range.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types, returning a descriptive level.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use its validation methods in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**

- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: For handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
