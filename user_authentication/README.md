# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input data. It likely includes functions to check the format and integrity of user-provided information.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file contains 2198 characters and is dedicated to handling user authentication processes. It may include functions for user login, registration, password management, and session handling.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation logic and customize it as needed for your project.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to implement user authentication features such as login, registration, and session management.
3. Integrate these files into your project's authentication system by importing the necessary functions and utilizing them as required.
