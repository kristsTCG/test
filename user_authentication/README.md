# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for authentication logic.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
  
- **auth.py**: This file handles the authentication logic for users. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the system.

## Usage
1. To utilize the input validation functions, refer to `validator.js`. You can import and use the validation functions in your JavaScript code to ensure data integrity.
   
2. For user authentication tasks such as login and registration, refer to `auth.py`. This file contains the necessary functions and logic to authenticate users within the system.

3. Ensure to follow the documentation within each file for specific function usage and parameters. Additionally, maintain the integrity of the authentication process to secure user data effectively.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates a password based on specific criteria (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates a username for length and character restrictions.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** This file can be imported as a module in a Node.js application using `const InputValidator = require('./validator.js');`. Then, you can use the provided validation functions as needed.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes the password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates the user with the provided username and password, returning a session token if successful.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends the user session associated with the provided session token.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if the session token is valid and the user is authenticated.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: Used for hashing passwords.
- `json`: Not used in the provided code but imported.
- `datetime`: Used for working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: Used for calculating time differences.
- `typing`: Used for type hints.
