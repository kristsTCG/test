# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This functionality is responsible for validating user input and handling user authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` consists of two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters that handles user input validation.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters that manages user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
The `validator.js` file is crucial for ensuring that user input is validated before further processing. It contains functions and logic to validate user input data, such as email addresses, passwords, and other relevant information.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is essential for managing user authentication within the project. It handles processes such as user login, registration, password hashing, and token generation for secure authentication.

## Usage
To utilize the functionality provided by the `user_authentication` folder, follow these steps:
1. Use the functions defined in `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing.
2. Implement the authentication processes defined in `auth.py` for user registration, login, and secure authentication within the project.

Ensure that you integrate these files appropriately within your project to maintain secure and reliable user authentication functionality.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength calculation.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates a password based on specific criteria (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates a username for length and allowed characters (alphanumeric and underscores).
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class from `validator.js` in your code.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class managing user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON handling.
- `datetime`: For date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For time duration calculations.
- `typing`: For type hints.
