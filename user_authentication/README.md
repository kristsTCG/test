## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session by invalidating the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to access user authentication functionalities like registration, login, logout, and session validation.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib` for password hashing.
- `json` for JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime` for handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta` for calculating time differences.
