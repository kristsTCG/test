# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder consists of two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters that handles user input validation.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters responsible for user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file is crucial for ensuring that user input is validated according to specified criteria. It plays a significant role in maintaining data integrity and security within the application.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is essential for handling user authentication processes, such as login, registration, and session management. It is responsible for verifying user credentials and granting access to authorized users.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality, refer to the `validator.js` file and incorporate the validation logic into the relevant parts of the application where user input validation is required.

2. For user authentication processes, interact with the `auth.py` file to implement login, registration, and session management functionalities. Ensure proper integration with other parts of the project that require user authentication.

3. Maintain the integrity and security of user data by regularly updating and enhancing the validation and authentication mechanisms within this folder.

By following the guidelines outlined in the key files and usage instructions, developers can effectively implement and manage user authentication functionalities within the project.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file contains input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**

- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates a password based on specific criteria (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates a username for length (3-20 characters) and alphanumeric characters with underscores only.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** This file can be imported into other JavaScript files using `require` or `import` statements, and the functions can be called as static methods of the `InputValidator` class.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
