# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes validation logic in JavaScript and authentication logic in Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks. It contains two key files: `validator.js` for input validation and `auth.py` for user authentication.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters of code responsible for validating user inputs. It ensures that the data entered by users meets specified criteria before processing.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file consists of 2198 characters of code dedicated to user authentication. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
- Use `validator.js` to validate user inputs before processing them.
- Incorporate `auth.py` to handle user authentication tasks such as login, registration, and authentication processes.
