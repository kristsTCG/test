# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for authentication logic.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input to ensure data integrity and security.
- **auth.py**: This file implements authentication logic such as user login, registration, and password management.

## Usage
1. To use the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the file in your JavaScript code and call the appropriate validation functions as needed.
2. For authentication tasks, utilize the functions provided in `auth.py` by importing the file in your Python code and invoking the necessary authentication methods.

Ensure to follow the documentation within each file for specific usage instructions and parameters.
