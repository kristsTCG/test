## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: Responsible for validating user input.
   - Language: JavaScript
   - Size: 1212 characters

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Manages user authentication processes.
   - Language: Python
   - Size: 2198 characters

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in the `user_authentication` folder, follow these steps:
1. Use `validator.js` for validating user input in JavaScript applications.
2. Incorporate `auth.py` to handle user authentication processes in Python-based projects.

- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username, allowing alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password and returns a descriptive level.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
