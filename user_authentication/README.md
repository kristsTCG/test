# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains the logic for validating user input, ensuring that data entered by users meets specified criteria. It plays a crucial role in maintaining data integrity and security.
  
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication using Python. This file is essential for securing user accounts and ensuring authorized access to the system.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder, developers can refer to the respective files for implementing user authentication features. They can integrate the validation logic from `validator.js` into their frontend applications to ensure data integrity. Similarly, the `auth.py` file can be used to manage user authentication on the backend, enabling secure user access control. Developers should follow the documentation within each file for proper implementation and customization according to project requirements.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if a password meets certain criteria (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if a username meets certain criteria (3-20 characters, alphanumeric and underscores only).
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
