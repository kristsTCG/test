# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input and ensuring data integrity during the authentication process.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python file contains 2198 characters and manages the authentication logic, including user login, registration, and session management.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review `validator.js` to understand the validation rules and data integrity checks implemented for user input.
2. Explore `auth.py` to grasp the authentication logic, including user login, registration, and session management.
3. Modify the files as needed to customize user authentication processes for the project.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file contains input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username inputs, as well as determining the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username allowing only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class where input validation is needed and call the respective validation methods as needed.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class managing user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash passwords using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
