# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input data for authentication purposes.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file contains 2198 characters and handles the authentication logic for users, including login, registration, and token generation.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication features in the project, developers can refer to the `validator.js` file for input validation requirements and the `auth.py` file for implementing authentication functionalities. Ensure to follow the coding standards and guidelines set in these files for seamless integration with the project's authentication system.
