# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This module handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side validation and auth.py for server-side authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It ensures that user-provided data meets specified criteria before submission.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for server-side authentication processes. It manages user authentication, login, and session handling within the application.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionalities in this folder:
1. Modify `validator.js` to customize client-side validation rules as needed.
2. Implement the authentication logic in `auth.py` to suit the project's requirements.
3. Ensure proper integration of these files with other components that interact with user authentication features.
