# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data, ensuring that the data meets specified criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` manages user authentication tasks such as login, logout, and session management. It interacts with the database to verify user credentials and maintain user sessions securely.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - To use the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript project.
   - Call the appropriate validation functions with user input data as parameters to ensure data integrity before authentication.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Import `auth.py` into your Python project to access the authentication functionalities.
   - Utilize the provided functions for user login, logout, and session management.
   - Ensure proper configuration of the database connection for seamless user authentication processes.
