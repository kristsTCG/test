# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and handling user authentication using JavaScript and Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks using different programming languages. The key components include a JavaScript file for validation (`validator.js`) and a Python file for authentication (`auth.py`).

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input, ensuring data integrity and security.
- `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes, such as login, registration, and session management.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code and call the appropriate functions to validate user input.
2. For user authentication tasks, import `auth.py` into your Python code and use the provided functions for user login, registration, and session management. Ensure to handle authentication securely to protect user data.

Remember to follow best practices for user authentication and data validation to maintain the security and integrity of the application.
