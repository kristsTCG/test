# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This module is responsible for validating user input and managing user authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication tasks within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation logic and criteria for user input.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to grasp the user authentication processes and functions available.
3. Integrate the validation and authentication functionalities into the project as needed, ensuring proper error handling and security measures are in place.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is between 3-20 characters long and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of the input password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** This file can be imported into other JavaScript files using `require` or `import` statements to perform input validation for user authentication.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication within your application.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints (not used in this file).
