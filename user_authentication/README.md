## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input data for authentication purposes.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file contains 2198 characters and handles the authentication logic for users, such as login, logout, and session management.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review `validator.js` for user input validation functions and customize them as needed.
2. Explore `auth.py` to understand the authentication logic and make any necessary adjustments for the project's requirements.
