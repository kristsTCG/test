# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file contains 2198 characters and handles the authentication logic for users. It manages the authentication process, such as verifying user credentials and granting access to authorized users.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
- Use `validator.js` to validate user input data before authentication.
- Utilize `auth.py` for handling user authentication processes within the project.
- Ensure to understand the functions and methods defined in each file to integrate user authentication securely into the project.

- `logout`: Method to end a user's session by removing the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication processes.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: Used for hashing passwords.
- `json`: Not used in the provided code but imported.
