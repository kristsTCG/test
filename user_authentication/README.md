# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for authentication logic.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This file contains functions for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
   
2. `auth.py`: This file contains authentication logic written in Python. It manages user authentication processes such as login, logout, and session management within the project.

## Usage
1. To utilize the input validation functionalities, refer to the `validator.js` file and import the necessary functions into your codebase.
   
2. For user authentication tasks, utilize the functions and classes defined in the `auth.py` file. Ensure to follow the authentication flow and integrate it seamlessly into your project's user management system.

- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username (alphanumeric and underscores, 3-20 characters).
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file and use its static methods for input validation.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py
