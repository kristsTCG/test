# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It includes validation logic in JavaScript and authentication logic in Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication processes. It contains two key files, `validator.js` for input validation and `auth.py` for user authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains logic for validating user inputs. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication within the project. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes.

## Usage
Developers can utilize the `validator.js` file to implement input validation for user data. This ensures that only valid inputs are accepted for authentication purposes. The `auth.py` file can be used to integrate user authentication functionalities into the project, such as user login and registration processes. Developers can refer to these files to understand and customize the user authentication mechanisms in the project.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email address is in a correct format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of being at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and a number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is between 3-20 characters long and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types, returning a descriptive strength level.

**Usage:** This file can be imported as a module to perform input validation tasks in user authentication workflows.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies are required for this file.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication system. Call methods like `register_user`, `login`, `logout`, and `is_authenticated` as needed.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib` for hashing functions.
- `json` for JSON serialization.
- `datetime` for handling date and time.
- `timedelta` for calculating time differences.
- `typing` for type hints.
