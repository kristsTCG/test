# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for authentication logic.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
   
2. **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It includes functions for user login, registration, and authentication checks. This file is essential for securing user access to the system.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review `validator.js` to understand the validation rules applied to user input data.
2. Explore `auth.py` to familiarize yourself with the authentication logic and functions available for user authentication tasks.
3. Modify and extend the existing codebase as needed to customize user authentication processes for your project.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file contains input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates a password based on length and character requirements.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates a username for length and character restrictions.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on various criteria.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class in your code:
```javascript
const InputValidator = require('./validator.js');
```
Then, you can call the validation functions like `InputValidator.validateEmail('example@email.com')`.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
  - `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
  - `logout`: Method to end a user session.
  - `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON operations.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
