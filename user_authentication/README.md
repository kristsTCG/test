# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This module is responsible for validating user input and handling user authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python. These files work together to provide user authentication features.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It includes functions for user login, registration, and authentication.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided by the `user_authentication` module, follow these steps:
1. Use the functions defined in `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing it further.
2. Import and utilize the functions from `auth.py` to handle user authentication tasks such as user login, registration, and authentication processes.

Ensure that you follow the guidelines and best practices outlined in the respective files to maintain secure and efficient user authentication within the project.
