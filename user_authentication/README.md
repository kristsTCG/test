# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation logic and authentication methods.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` for validation logic in JavaScript and `auth.py` for authentication methods in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains 1212 characters of JavaScript code responsible for validating user input and ensuring data integrity.
- **auth.py**: With 2198 characters, this Python file manages user authentication processes such as login, registration, and password management.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed for user input fields.
   - Integrate the validation logic into your frontend forms to ensure data accuracy.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Import the necessary functions from `auth.py` to handle user authentication tasks.
   - Customize the authentication methods to align with your project's requirements.

Ensure that both files are appropriately linked and called within your project to enable seamless user authentication functionality.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if a password meets complexity requirements.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** This file can be imported into other JavaScript files using `require` or `import` statements.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class managing user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: for hashing functions.
- `json`: for JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: for working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: for representing differences between dates or times.
- `typing`: for type hints and annotations.
