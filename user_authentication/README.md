# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder consists of two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters responsible for input validation.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file is crucial for validating user input to ensure data integrity and security within the authentication system.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is essential for managing user authentication processes, such as login, logout, and user session handling.

## Usage
To utilize the code in this folder:
1. Review `validator.js` for input validation rules and implement them in your user input forms.
2. Understand the functions in `auth.py` to integrate user authentication features into your project.
3. Ensure proper error handling and security measures are in place when using these authentication components.
