# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submission.
  
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is responsible for server-side authentication processes. It manages user authentication, login, and logout functionalities within the project.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Use `validator.js` for client-side validation by including it in your frontend code.
2. Utilize `auth.py` for server-side authentication by importing it into your backend code and calling its functions as needed.

Ensure that the functionalities provided by these files align with the project's user authentication requirements.
