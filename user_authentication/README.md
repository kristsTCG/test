# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This module handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side validation and auth.py for server-side authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring data integrity before submitting to the server.
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for server-side authentication processes. It manages user authentication, login, and authorization within the system.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication features in this folder:
1. Modify `validator.js` to customize client-side validation rules as needed.
2. Implement server-side authentication logic in `auth.py` to authenticate users securely.
3. Ensure proper integration of these files with other parts of the project that require user authentication functionalities.
