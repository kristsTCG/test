# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder consists of two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters responsible for validating user input.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file contains functions for validating user input to ensure data integrity and security.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file manages user authentication processes such as login, logout, and user session management.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code and call the appropriate validation functions as needed.
2. For user authentication functionalities, import `auth.py` into your Python code and use the provided functions for user login, logout, and session management.
