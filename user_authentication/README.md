# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for authentication logic.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that the data entered by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
   
2. **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It contains functions and logic to authenticate users based on their credentials.

## Usage
1. To use the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code and call the appropriate validation functions as needed.
   
2. For user authentication tasks, utilize the functions and logic provided in `auth.py`. Import the file into your Python code and invoke the necessary functions to authenticate users securely.

Ensure that you follow the guidelines and best practices outlined in each file to maintain a secure and reliable user authentication system.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is between 3-20 characters, alphanumeric, and underscores only.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of the input password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class managing user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON operations.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `typing`: For type hints.
