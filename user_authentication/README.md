# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder consists of two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters responsible for validating user input.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file is crucial for ensuring that user input meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication. It plays a key role in maintaining data integrity and security.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is essential for managing user authentication within the project. It handles user login, registration, and authentication processes to ensure secure access to the system.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality, refer to the `validator.js` file and integrate the validation logic into the appropriate parts of your project.
2. For user authentication processes, make use of the functions and methods defined in the `auth.py` file. Ensure proper integration with other components of the project for seamless user authentication.
