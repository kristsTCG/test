# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate the validation logic in `validator.js` written in JavaScript and the authentication logic in `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This file contains the validation logic for user inputs. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
   
2. **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file contains the authentication logic for verifying user credentials and granting access to authorized users.

## Usage
1. To work with the validation logic, refer to `validator.js` and customize the validation rules as needed.
   
2. For authentication processes, utilize the functions and methods defined in `auth.py` to authenticate users and manage access control within the application.
