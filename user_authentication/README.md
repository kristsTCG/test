# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for authentication processes.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file handles the authentication logic for users. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the system.

## Usage
To utilize the functionality provided in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file for input validation requirements and integrate it into the user input forms.
2. Utilize the functions in `auth.py` for user authentication processes such as login, registration, and authentication checks.
3. Ensure that the authentication logic in `auth.py` aligns with the project's security requirements and user management system.
