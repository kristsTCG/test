# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It currently contains two key files: `validator.js` and `auth.py`.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
- `auth.py`: This Python file handles the authentication logic for users. It manages user login, registration, and other authentication-related tasks within the project.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder, you can refer to the following guidelines:
1. Use `validator.js` functions to validate user input before processing authentication requests.
2. Utilize `auth.py` for implementing user authentication functionalities such as login, registration, and password reset.
3. Ensure to maintain the integrity of the authentication process by following the defined logic in these files.

- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength level of a password based on various criteria.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
