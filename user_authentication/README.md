# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It ensures that user-provided data meets the required criteria before sending it to the server for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python file handles server-side authentication processes. It includes functions for user login, registration, and authentication using secure methods.

## Usage
1. To utilize the client-side validation provided by `validator.js`, include this file in your HTML code using a script tag.
   
   Example:
   ```html
   <script src="path/to/validator.js"></script>
   ```

2. Use the functions defined in `auth.py` for server-side authentication tasks. Import the file in your Python code to access these functions.

   Example:
   ```python
   from user_authentication.auth import login, register, authenticate
   ```

3. Ensure to customize the authentication logic according to your project requirements and security standards.

- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric and underscore characters.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on various criteria.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class managing user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token for active sessions.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by removing the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib` for hashing functions.
- `json` for JSON handling.
- `datetime` for date and time operations.
- `timedelta` for time duration calculations.
- `typing` for type hints.
