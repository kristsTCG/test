# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submission.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file handles server-side authentication processes. It manages user authentication, such as login, logout, and session management.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**: Developers can modify the validation rules in this file to suit the project's requirements. Ensure that the validation logic aligns with the backend validation to maintain data integrity.
   
2. **auth.py**: Utilize the functions provided in this file to implement user authentication features in the project. Customize the authentication logic as needed to enhance security and user experience.
