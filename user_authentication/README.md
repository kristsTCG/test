# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate the validation logic implemented in `validator.js` (JavaScript) and the authentication functionality in `auth.py` (Python).

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This file contains the JavaScript code for validating user input and ensuring data integrity. It plays a crucial role in verifying user-provided information before proceeding with authentication processes.
  
- `auth.py`: The `auth.py` file is written in Python and is responsible for handling user authentication tasks. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the application.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation capabilities, refer to `validator.js` and integrate the validation functions into your user input forms.
   
2. For authentication tasks, utilize the functions and methods defined in `auth.py` to manage user login, registration, and authentication processes effectively.

3. Ensure to maintain the integrity of the authentication processes by following the guidelines and logic implemented in these files.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates an email address based on a regular expression pattern.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates a password based on length and character requirements.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates a username based on length and allowed characters.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character complexity.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session by invalidating the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For handling JSON data.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
