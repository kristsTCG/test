# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains the following key components:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters that handles input validation for user authentication.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters responsible for implementing the authentication logic.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file is crucial for ensuring that user input for authentication is valid and secure. It plays a key role in preventing malicious input and maintaining data integrity.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is essential for handling user authentication processes within the project. It manages user login, registration, and authentication, ensuring secure access to the system.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review `validator.js` to understand the input validation rules and make any necessary adjustments.
2. Study `auth.py` to grasp the authentication logic and customize it according to project requirements.
3. Ensure that both files are integrated correctly within the project to enable seamless user authentication processes.
