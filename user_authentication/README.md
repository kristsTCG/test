# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This functionality is crucial for managing user access and security.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side validation and auth.py for server-side authentication logic.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It plays a key role in ensuring that user data is correctly formatted before submission.
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for server-side authentication processes. It manages user authentication, authorization, and session handling within the application.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to suit the project's requirements.
   - Include the `validator.js` file in your HTML pages using the `<script>` tag.
   - Call the validation functions from your form submission logic to validate user input.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Implement additional authentication checks or custom logic within the `auth.py` file.
   - Integrate the authentication functions with your backend services or API endpoints.
   - Ensure proper error handling and secure authentication practices are followed to protect user data.

By following the guidelines outlined in the key files, you can effectively manage user authentication within your project.
