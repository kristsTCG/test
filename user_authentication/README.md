# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files, `validator.js` and `auth.py`, written in JavaScript and Python, respectively.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**:
   - Language: JavaScript
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Role: Responsible for validating user input data and ensuring data integrity during the authentication process.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Language: Python
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Role: Manages user authentication, including login, registration, and session handling functionalities.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review `validator.js` for input validation logic and modify it as needed.
2. Explore `auth.py` to understand the user authentication flow and customize it according to project requirements.
3. Ensure proper integration of these files with other components that interact with user authentication functionalities.
