## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Language: JavaScript
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Role: Responsible for validating user input data and ensuring it meets the required criteria for authentication.

2. **auth.py**
   - Language: Python
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Role: Manages the authentication process, including verifying user credentials and granting access to authorized users.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**
   - Modify the validation rules in `validator.js` to customize the validation criteria for user input data.
   - Import and use the validation functions in other parts of the project where user input needs to be validated.

2. **auth.py**
   - Implement additional authentication methods or security measures in `auth.py` to enhance user authentication processes.
   - Integrate the authentication functionalities provided in `auth.py` with other parts of the project that require user authentication.

Ensure to test any modifications made to the files in this folder to maintain the security and integrity of the user authentication system.
