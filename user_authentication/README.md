# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This module handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side validation written in JavaScript and auth.py for server-side authentication written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring data integrity and security on the client side.
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is responsible for server-side authentication processes. It manages user authentication, authorization, and session handling on the server.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication features:
1. Use `validator.js` for client-side validation by including it in your HTML files.
2. Implement server-side authentication using `auth.py` in your Python backend.
3. Ensure to integrate both client-side and server-side logic to create a secure and reliable authentication system.
