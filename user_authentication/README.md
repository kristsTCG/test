## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` contains two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters responsible for user input validation.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters that manage user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Role**: Handles user input validation.
- **Size**: 1212 characters
- **Language**: JavaScript

### auth.py
- **Role**: Manages user authentication processes.
- **Size**: 2198 characters
- **Language**: Python

## Usage
1. To utilize the user input validation functionality, refer to `validator.js`. Modify the validation rules as needed within this file.
2. For user authentication processes, interact with `auth.py`. Implement login, registration, and authentication logic within this Python file.
