# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It includes validation logic in JavaScript and authentication logic in Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks. The key components include a JavaScript file for data validation and a Python file for user authentication.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters of code responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
   
2. **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` consists of 2198 characters of code that handle user authentication processes. It verifies user credentials and grants access based on the authentication status.

## Usage
To utilize the code in this folder:
- Use `validator.js` to validate user input data before initiating the authentication process.
- Incorporate `auth.py` to authenticate users based on their credentials and grant access to authorized users.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates an email address format using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates a password format requiring at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and a number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates a username format requiring 3-20 characters, alphanumeric and underscores only.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
