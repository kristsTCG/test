# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- Role: Responsible for validating user input data.
- Size: 1212 characters
- Language: JavaScript

### auth.py
- Role: Handles user authentication processes.
- Size: 2198 characters
- Language: Python

## Usage
1. To utilize the input validation functionality, refer to `validator.js`. Modify the validation rules as needed for the project requirements.
2. For user authentication tasks, utilize `auth.py`. Implement the authentication logic based on the project's authentication requirements.
3. Ensure to maintain the integrity of the authentication processes and keep the validation rules up to date to enhance security.
