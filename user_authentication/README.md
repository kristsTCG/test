# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side input validation and auth.py for server-side authentication logic.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submission.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for server-side authentication processes. It manages user authentication, login, and authorization within the system.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**: To utilize the client-side validation provided by `validator.js`, include the file in your HTML document using a script tag. You can then call the validation functions as needed to validate user input before form submission.

2. **auth.py**: Incorporate the authentication functionalities provided by `auth.py` into your server-side codebase. Import the necessary functions and classes to handle user authentication, login, and authorization within your application.

Ensure that you follow the guidelines and best practices outlined in each file for secure and efficient user authentication processes.

- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength level of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** To use this file, import it as `InputValidator` in your JavaScript code.

```javascript
const InputValidator = require('./validator.js');

// Example usage
if (InputValidator.validateEmail('example@email.com')) {
    // Email is valid
}

const passwordStrength = InputValidator.getPasswordStrength('SecurePass123');
console.log(passwordStrength); // Output: 'Good'
```
