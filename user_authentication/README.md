# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains code for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling the authentication process. It manages user login, registration, and authentication logic within the system.

## Usage
To utilize the functionality provided in this folder, you can refer to the specific functions and methods defined in `validator.js` and `auth.py`. Ensure that you integrate these files into the appropriate parts of your project where user authentication is required. Make sure to follow any guidelines or documentation provided within the files for seamless integration and usage.
