# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input data related to authentication processes.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file is 2198 characters long and contains the authentication logic for verifying user credentials and managing user sessions.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities in this folder:
- Review and understand the code in `validator.js` for handling user input validation.
- Explore the `auth.py` file to understand the authentication logic and session management.
- Make necessary modifications or integrations based on project requirements.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username inputs, as well as determining the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if a password meets the criteria of being at least 8 characters long with uppercase, lowercase, and a number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if a username is between 3 to 20 characters long and consists of alphanumeric characters and underscores only.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on its length and character composition.

**Usage:** To use this file, import it into your JavaScript file using `require` or `import` statements.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password, generating a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by invalidating the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** To use this file, create an instance of the `UserAuth` class and call its methods for user registration, login, logout, and authentication.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For handling JSON data.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
