# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for authentication processes.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This file contains functions for validating user input to ensure data integrity and security.
- `auth.py`: The `auth.py` file handles user authentication processes such as login, registration, and password management.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the necessary functions into your JavaScript files and call them as needed to validate user input.
2. For user authentication tasks, import the `auth.py` module in your Python scripts and utilize the provided functions for user login, registration, and password management.
3. Ensure to follow best practices for user authentication and input validation to maintain the security of the application.
