# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication tasks within the application.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
- Review and understand the functions defined in `validator.js` for user input validation.
- Utilize the functionalities provided in `auth.py` for user authentication tasks such as login, registration, and authentication.
- Ensure to integrate these files appropriately within the project's authentication system for secure user interactions.
