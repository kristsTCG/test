# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized with two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters responsible for validating user input.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file is crucial for ensuring that user input meets the required criteria and is safe for processing within the system.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file manages user authentication within the project, handling processes such as user login, registration, and access control.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality, refer to the `validator.js` file and integrate the validation methods into your user input forms.
2. For user authentication processes, utilize the functions and methods defined in the `auth.py` file to handle user login, registration, and access control within your project.
