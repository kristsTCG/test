# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This module handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder consists of two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters, responsible for validating user input data.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters, which manages user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file is crucial for ensuring that user input data is valid before proceeding with authentication. It contains functions for validating various user inputs such as email addresses, passwords, and other relevant data.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is responsible for handling user authentication within the project. It includes functions for user login, registration, password hashing, and token generation.

## Usage
To utilize the functionality provided by the `user_authentication` module, follow these steps:
1. Use the functions defined in `validator.js` to validate user input data before proceeding with authentication processes.
2. Import and utilize the functions from `auth.py` to handle user authentication tasks such as registration, login, password management, and token generation.

Ensure that you understand the specific requirements and implementation details of the user authentication module before integrating it into your project.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates and returns the strength level of a password.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class where input validation is needed.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the provided session token.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid and the user is authenticated.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations. Call methods like `register_user`, `login`, `logout`, and `is_authenticated` as needed.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: Used for password hashing.
- `json`: Imported but not used in the provided code.
- `datetime`: Used for timestamp handling.
- `timedelta`: Used for calculating session expiration time.
- `typing.Optional`, `typing.Dict`: Used for type hints.
