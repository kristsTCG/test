# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes validation logic in JavaScript and authentication logic in Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks. It contains two key files, `validator.js` for input validation and `auth.py` for user authentication.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains logic for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
- `auth.py`: This Python file handles user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication tasks within the system.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation capabilities, refer to `validator.js` for functions related to input validation.
2. For user authentication tasks, interact with `auth.py` to manage user login, registration, and authentication processes.
3. Ensure to integrate these files into the broader project structure for seamless user authentication functionality.
