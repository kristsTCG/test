# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This functionality is responsible for validating user input and handling user authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to include two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file containing validation logic for user input.
- `auth.py`: A Python file handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- Role: Responsible for validating user input.
- Size: 1212 characters
- Language: JavaScript

### auth.py
- Role: Handles user authentication processes.
- Size: 2198 characters
- Language: Python

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Modify the `validator.js` file to customize the validation logic for user input.
2. Update the `auth.py` file to enhance or modify user authentication processes.
3. Ensure that any changes made adhere to the project's authentication requirements and security standards.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as checking password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the format of a password (minimum 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username (3-20 characters, alphanumeric and underscores only).
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session based on the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and the user is authenticated.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing.Optional`: For type hinting.
- `typing.Dict`: For type hinting.
