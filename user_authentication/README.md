# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submission.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python file handles server-side authentication processes. It manages user authentication, login, and session handling within the application.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
1. Modify the validation rules in `validator.js` to suit the specific requirements of the project.
2. Implement the authentication logic in `auth.py` to authenticate users and manage their sessions effectively.
