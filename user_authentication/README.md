- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters responsible for validating user input.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters that handle user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Role**: Responsible for validating user input.
- **Character Count**: 1212
- **Usage**: Ensures that user-provided data meets specified criteria before further processing.

### auth.py
- **Role**: Handles user authentication processes.
- **Character Count**: 2198
- **Usage**: Manages user login, registration, and authentication within the system.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality provided by `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code and call the appropriate validation functions as needed.
