# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**:
   - Language: JavaScript
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Role: Responsible for validating user input data to ensure it meets the required criteria for authentication.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Language: Python
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Role: Contains the authentication logic for verifying user credentials and managing user sessions.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - To use the `validator.js` file, import it into your JavaScript code using `import validator from './validator.js';`.
   - Call the appropriate validation functions provided in the file to validate user input data before processing it for authentication.

2. **auth.py**:
   - To utilize the `auth.py` file, import it into your Python code using `import auth`.
   - Use the functions defined in `auth.py` to authenticate users, verify credentials, and manage user sessions within your application.

Ensure to follow the documentation and comments within each file for a better understanding of the functions and methods available for user authentication.
