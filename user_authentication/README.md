## Structure
The folder consists of two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters responsible for validating user input data.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters that manage user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- Role: Responsible for validating user input data.
- Size: 1212 characters

### auth.py
- Role: Manages user authentication processes.
- Size: 2198 characters

## Usage
1. To utilize the user validation functionality, refer to `validator.js`. Modify or extend the validation rules as needed.
2. For user authentication processes, utilize `auth.py`. Implement login, registration, and authentication logic using the provided functions.

Ensure to maintain the integrity of the authentication processes and follow best practices for user data security.
