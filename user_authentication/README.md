# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. It is responsible for validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input related to authentication. It ensures that the data entered by the user meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- `auth.py`: This Python file contains 2198 characters and is crucial for handling the authentication process. It manages user authentication, including login, logout, and user session management.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality, refer to `validator.js` and incorporate the validation logic into your user input forms.
   
2. For authentication processes, interact with `auth.py` to implement user login, logout, and session management features within your project. Make sure to follow the defined authentication flow and integrate it with your application's user management system.
