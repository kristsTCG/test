# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This module handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` contains two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters responsible for validating user input data.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters that manage user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
The `validator.js` file is crucial for ensuring the validity of user input data. It contains functions to validate user information such as email addresses, passwords, and other input fields.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file handles user authentication within the project. It includes functions for user login, registration, password reset, and other authentication-related tasks.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Use the functions in `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing it.
2. Utilize the functions in `auth.py` for user authentication processes such as login, registration, and password management.

Ensure to integrate these files into the project's authentication flow to enhance security and user experience.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is between 3-20 characters long and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on its length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use its validation functions in user authentication processes.

**Dependencies:** None

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Register a new user with a unique username.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticate user and return a session token.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: End a user session.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Check if a session token is still valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to manage user authentication. Call `register_user` to add new users, `login` to authenticate users and get a session token, `logout` to end a session, and `is_authenticated` to check session validity.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: for hashing passwords.
- `json`: for JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: for handling date and time.
- `timedelta`: for time calculations.
- `typing`: for type hinting.
