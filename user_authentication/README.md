# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This module is responsible for validating user input and managing user authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` consists of two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters, responsible for validating user input data.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters, responsible for handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Role**: Validates user input data to ensure it meets specified criteria.
- **Character Count**: 1212
- **Usage**: Used to validate user input such as email addresses, passwords, and other user-related data.

### auth.py
- **Role**: Manages user authentication processes such as login, logout, and user session management.
- **Character Count**: 2198
- **Usage**: Handles user authentication functionalities and interacts with the database for user authentication.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality, refer to `validator.js` and import the necessary functions to validate user input data.
2. For user authentication processes, refer to `auth.py` and use the provided functions for user login, logout, and session management.

Ensure that the functions from these files are appropriately integrated into the project's user authentication flow for secure and reliable user authentication processes.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file contains input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username allowing alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Method to register a new user.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Method to authenticate a user and return a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Method to end a user session.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Method to check if a session is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to manage user authentication operations. Call `register_user` to register a new user, `login` to authenticate and get a session token, `logout` to end a session, and `is_authenticated` to check session validity.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib` for hashing functions
- `json` for JSON operations
- `datetime` for date and time handling
- `timedelta` from `datetime` for time calculations
- `typing.Optional` for type hinting
- `typing.Dict` for type hinting
