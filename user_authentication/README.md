# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` contains two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters, responsible for validating user input.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters, handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
The `validator.js` file is crucial for ensuring that user input is validated correctly before being processed. It contains functions and logic to validate user data such as email addresses, passwords, and other input fields.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is responsible for handling user authentication processes within the project. This file manages user login, registration, and authentication using Python. It interacts with the database to verify user credentials and grant access to authorized users.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation logic and customize it as needed for specific input requirements.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to understand how user authentication processes are implemented in Python. Modify the authentication logic to align with project requirements.
3. Ensure that both files are integrated correctly with other parts of the project that require user authentication functionality. Test thoroughly to validate user input and authentication processes.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username inputs, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username allowing alphanumeric characters and underscores within a specific length range.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character complexity.

**Usage:** To use this file, you can import `InputValidator` class in your code and call the validation methods as needed.

```javascript
const InputValidator = require('./validator.js');

if (InputValidator.validateEmail('example@email.com')) {
    console.log('Email is valid');
}

const passwordStrength = InputValidator.getPasswordStrength('StrongPassword123');
console.log('Password strength:', passwordStrength);
```

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** User authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class managing user authentication operations.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Register a new user with a unique username.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticate user and return a session token.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: End a user session.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For handling dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
