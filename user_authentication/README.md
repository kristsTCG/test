# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` contains two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters that handles user input validation.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters responsible for user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Role**: Handles validation of user input data.
- **Character Count**: 1212
- **Usage**: Used to ensure that user input meets specified criteria before processing.

### auth.py
- **Role**: Manages user authentication processes.
- **Character Count**: 2198
- **Usage**: Responsible for authenticating users and managing access control within the system.

## Usage
1. To use the `validator.js` file:
   - Ensure the file is imported into the relevant JavaScript file.
   - Call the validation functions provided within `validator.js` to validate user input data.

2. To work with `auth.py`:
   - Import the file into the Python script where authentication is required.
   - Utilize the functions and methods within `auth.py` to authenticate users and manage access control.

Ensure that both files are integrated correctly within the project to maintain secure user authentication processes.
