# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria for authentication.

2. **auth.py**: This Python file consists of 2198 characters and manages the authentication process for users. It handles user login, registration, and authentication using secure methods.

## Usage
To utilize the code in this folder effectively:
- Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules for user input data.
- Explore the `auth.py` file to implement user authentication features in the project.
- Ensure to integrate these files into the project's authentication system for secure user interactions.
