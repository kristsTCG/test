# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file consists of 2198 characters and handles the authentication logic for users. It verifies user credentials and manages the authentication process within the system.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in the `user_authentication` folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation criteria for user input.
2. Examine the `auth.py` file to comprehend the authentication logic implemented in the project.
3. Integrate these files into your project to enable user authentication features effectively.
