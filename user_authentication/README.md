The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It includes scripts for validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.

2. `auth.py`: This Python file, consisting of 2198 characters, handles the authentication logic for users. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the system.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation criteria for user input data.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to comprehend the authentication processes implemented for user management.
3. Integrate the validation and authentication scripts into your project as needed for user authentication functionalities.
