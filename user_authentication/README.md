## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes the following key components:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters for validating user inputs.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters for handling user authentication logic.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file is crucial for validating user inputs to ensure data integrity and security.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file plays a vital role in managing user authentication processes, such as login, logout, and user session handling.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Use the `validator.js` file to validate user inputs before processing them.
