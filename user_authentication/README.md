# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This functionality is crucial for managing user access and security.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication logic using both JavaScript and Python. The key components include a validator script in JavaScript and an authentication module in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains logic for validating user input related to authentication. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user data is correctly formatted and secure.
- `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It likely includes functions for user login, registration, and authentication checks.

## Usage
Developers can utilize the `validator.js` file to implement client-side validation for user input forms related to authentication. The `auth.py` file can be used to manage server-side authentication processes, such as verifying user credentials and generating authentication tokens. Ensure to follow the specific functions and methods defined in each file for seamless integration with the project's user authentication system.

- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates a password based on specific criteria (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates a username based on length and character restrictions.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py
