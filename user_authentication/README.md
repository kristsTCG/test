# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes validation logic in JavaScript and authentication logic in Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` for input validation and `auth.py` for user authentication.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters of code responsible for validating user inputs. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria before processing.
   
2. `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` contains 2198 characters of code dedicated to user authentication. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the project.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation logic, refer to `validator.js` for functions related to input validation. Modify or extend the validation rules as needed for your project requirements.

2. For user authentication tasks, interact with `auth.py` to implement login, registration, and authentication functionalities. Ensure to integrate this code with your project's user management system for secure authentication processes.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file contains input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length and character requirements.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username allowing only alphanumeric characters and underscores within a specific length range.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character complexity.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in other parts of the application.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
    - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
    - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and hashed password.
    - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
    - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the session token.
    - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to manage user authentication processes.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
