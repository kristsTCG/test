# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input data for authentication purposes.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file contains 2198 characters and is crucial for handling user authentication logic within the project.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
- Review `validator.js` for user input validation logic.
- Explore `auth.py` for user authentication functionalities.
- Ensure proper integration of these files with other parts of the project that require user authentication.
