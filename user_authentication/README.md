# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes a JavaScript file for validation logic and a Python file for handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` for client-side validation and `auth.py` for server-side authentication.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for client-side validation of user input data related to authentication. It ensures that the data entered by users meets the required criteria before submission.
  
- `auth.py`: This Python file contains 2198 characters and handles server-side authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication against the system's database.

## Usage
1. To utilize the client-side validation logic, refer to the `validator.js` file and incorporate the validation functions into your front-end forms.
   
2. For server-side authentication tasks, utilize the functionalities provided in the `auth.py` file. This includes handling user login requests, registration processes, and verifying user credentials against the database.

3. Ensure to maintain the integrity and security of user authentication processes by following best practices and regularly updating the authentication logic in these files.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric and underscore characters.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength level of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class and call the desired validation functions or password strength assessment function.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session based on the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations like registration, login, and session handling.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints (not used in this file).
