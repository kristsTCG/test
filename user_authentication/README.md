# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate the validation logic in `validator.js` written in JavaScript and the authentication logic in `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains the validation logic for user inputs and data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication within the system.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to suit the project requirements.
   - Import and utilize the validation functions in other parts of the project where user input validation is required.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Implement additional authentication methods or customize the existing ones to align with the project's authentication requirements.
   - Integrate the authentication logic with other parts of the system that require user authentication.

Ensure to maintain the integrity of the authentication and validation processes to enhance the security and reliability of the user authentication system.

- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric and underscore characters.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the provided validation methods in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, logout, and session authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** To use this file, create an instance of `UserAuth` and call its methods for user registration, login, logout, and session validation.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
