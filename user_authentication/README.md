# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes scripts for validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: Responsible for validating user input data.
   - Language: JavaScript
   - Size: 1212 characters

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Manages user authentication processes.
   - Language: Python
   - Size: 2198 characters

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality, refer to `validator.js` and incorporate the validation logic into your user input forms or data processing scripts.

2. For user authentication tasks, utilize `auth.py` to handle user login, registration, and authentication processes within your project.

3. Ensure to maintain the integrity and security of user data by following best practices for user authentication and input validation.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric and underscore characters.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** This file can be imported as a module in other JavaScript files to perform input validation for user authentication.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies are required for this file.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and hashed password.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token for active sessions.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session by removing the session token from active sessions.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid and not expired.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to manage user authentication operations like registration, login, logout, and session validation.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing.Optional`: For type hinting optional return values.
- `typing.Dict`: For type hinting dictionary structures.
