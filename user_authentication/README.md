# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Type: JavaScript
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Role: Responsible for validating user input data to ensure it meets the required criteria for authentication.

2. **auth.py**
   - Type: Python
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Role: Manages the authentication process for users, including login, logout, and session management.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to suit the project's requirements.
   - Import the `validator.js` file into relevant modules where user input validation is required.

2. **auth.py**
   - Utilize the functions provided in `auth.py` for user authentication tasks.
   - Ensure proper configuration of authentication settings and integration with other parts of the project that require user authentication.

By following the guidelines provided in the key files, developers can effectively implement user authentication features in the project using the code within this folder.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength and format of a password (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username (3-20 characters, alphanumeric and underscores only).
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Method to register a new user.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Method to authenticate a user and return a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Method to end a user session.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
