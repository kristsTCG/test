## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: Responsible for validating user input data.
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Language: JavaScript

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Manages user authentication processes.
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Language: Python

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - To use the validator, import the `validator.js` file into your JavaScript code.
   - Call the appropriate validation functions provided within the file to validate user input data.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Import the `auth.py` file into your Python code to access authentication functionalities.
   - Utilize the functions defined in `auth.py` to handle user authentication processes within your application.

Ensure that you understand the functions and methods provided in each file to effectively implement user authentication features in your project.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**

- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username (alphanumeric and underscores only).
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on various criteria.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class from `validator.js` and call the desired validation functions or password strength function as needed.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
    - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
    - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user.
    - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
    - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session.
    - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to utilize user authentication functionalities.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `typing`: For type hints.
