# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. This module handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` consists of two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file containing functions for validating user input data. It is 1212 characters long.
- `auth.py`: A Python file responsible for user authentication logic. It is 2198 characters long.

## Key Files
### validator.js
The `validator.js` file is crucial for ensuring that user input data is valid before processing it further. It contains functions for validating various types of user data, such as email addresses, passwords, and usernames.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is essential for handling user authentication within the project. It includes functions for user login, registration, and password management. This file plays a vital role in ensuring secure access to the system.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Utilize the functions in `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing it.
2. Implement the authentication logic provided in `auth.py` to manage user login, registration, and password-related operations.
3. Ensure that the functions in both files are integrated correctly within the project's authentication flow to maintain secure user authentication processes.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if a password meets specific criteria (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if a username meets specific criteria (3-20 characters, alphanumeric and underscores only).
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints (not used in this file).
