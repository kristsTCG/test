# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This module is responsible for validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` consists of two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters, responsible for input validation.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters, handling user authentication logic.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Role**: Responsible for validating user input.
- **Character Count**: 1212
- **Usage**: Ensures that user input meets specified criteria before processing.

### auth.py
- **Role**: Handles user authentication processes.
- **Character Count**: 2198
- **Usage**: Manages user authentication, including login, registration, and access control.

## Usage
1. To utilize the input validation functionality, refer to `validator.js`. Modify the validation criteria as needed and ensure that user input meets the specified requirements.
2. For user authentication processes, interact with `auth.py`. Implement login, registration, and access control features based on the provided logic.

Ensure that both files are integrated correctly within the project to maintain secure and efficient user authentication.
