# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` for client-side input validation written in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication logic written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This file contains client-side validation logic to ensure that user input meets specified criteria before submitting it to the server. It plays a crucial role in enhancing user experience and data integrity.

2. `auth.py`: The `auth.py` file is responsible for server-side authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication using Python. This file is essential for securing user accounts and controlling access to protected resources.

## Usage
1. To utilize the client-side validation functionality, refer to the `validator.js` file. Customize the validation rules according to your project requirements by modifying the code within this file.

2. For server-side authentication tasks, interact with the `auth.py` file. Implement user registration, login, and authentication logic as needed. Ensure to integrate this file with other parts of the project that require user authentication.

3. Maintain consistency between client-side and server-side validation to ensure a seamless user authentication experience. Regularly update and test the code in these files to enhance security and user experience.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates a password based on length and character requirements.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates a username for length and character restrictions.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character complexity.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class where input validation is needed:
```javascript
const InputValidator = require('./validator.js');

if (InputValidator.validateEmail('example@email.com')) {
    // Email is valid
}

if (InputValidator.validatePassword('Password123')) {
    // Password is valid
}

if (InputValidator.validateUsername('user_name123')) {
    // Username is valid
}

const passwordStrength = InputValidator.getPasswordStrength('StrongPassword123');
console.log(passwordStrength); // Outputs the strength level of the password
```

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash passwords using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token for active sessions.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session based on the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and the session is still active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
