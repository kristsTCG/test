## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized with two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file containing functions for validating user input.
- `auth.py`: A Python file implementing authentication logic for users.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- Role: Handles validation of user input.
- Size: 1212 characters
- Language: JavaScript

### auth.py
- Role: Implements user authentication logic.
- Size: 2198 characters
- Language: Python

## Usage
1. To use the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code and call the appropriate validation functions as needed.
2. For user authentication logic, import `auth.py` into your Python code and utilize the authentication functions provided within the file. Make sure to handle user authentication securely and according to best practices.
