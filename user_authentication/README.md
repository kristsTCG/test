# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` and `auth.py`, which are responsible for validating user input and handling authentication logic, respectively.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input, ensuring that data entered by users meets specified criteria and is safe for processing.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python file handles the authentication process for users. It includes functions for user login, registration, and authentication checks.

## Usage
To utilize the functionality provided in this folder:
1. Use the functions defined in `validator.js` to validate user input before processing it further.
2. Import and utilize the functions in `auth.py` to handle user authentication tasks such as login, registration, and authentication checks.

Ensure that you follow the documentation within each file for proper usage and integration into your project.
