# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication features efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the data provided by the user meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file contains 2198 characters and handles the authentication logic for users. It verifies user credentials and manages the authentication process.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
- Use `validator.js` to validate user input data before proceeding with authentication.
- Utilize `auth.py` to authenticate users based on their credentials and manage the authentication flow.
- Ensure to integrate these files with other parts of the project that require user authentication functionalities.
