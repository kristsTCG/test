# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes a JavaScript file for validation logic and a Python file for handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to centralize all user authentication-related code. It currently contains two files: `validator.js` for client-side validation and `auth.py` for server-side authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains logic for validating user input on the client-side. It plays a crucial role in ensuring data integrity before submitting it to the server.
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes on the server-side. It manages user login, registration, and authentication logic.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to suit the project requirements.
   - Include this file in your HTML templates to enable client-side validation.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Configure the authentication settings such as database connections and encryption methods.
   - Integrate the authentication endpoints with your application's routing system.
   - Use the provided functions for user registration, login, and authentication.

Ensure to maintain the integrity and security of user authentication processes by following best practices and keeping the code up-to-date.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username allowing only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength level of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class where input validation is needed.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the session token.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: For handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For representing time intervals.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
