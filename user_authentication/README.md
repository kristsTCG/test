# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized with two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python. These files handle user input validation and authentication logic respectively.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
   
2. `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication logic. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the application.

## Usage
To utilize the functionality provided in this folder:
- Use the functions defined in `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing.
- Incorporate the authentication logic implemented in `auth.py` to manage user authentication processes within the application.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file contains input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username inputs, as well as determining the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of being at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and a number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is 3-20 characters long and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of the input password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** This file can be imported into other JavaScript files using `require` or `import` statements to utilize the input validation functions provided.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies are required for this file.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by invalidating the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and not expired.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations. Call methods like `register_user`, `login`, `logout`, and `is_authenticated` as needed.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints (not used in this file).
