# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input data related to authentication. It ensures that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file is 2198 characters long and handles the authentication logic for users. It manages the process of verifying user credentials and granting access to authorized users.

## Usage
To utilize the functionality provided in this folder:
1. Review and understand the validation rules defined in `validator.js`.
2. Implement the authentication logic as needed using the functions and methods defined in `auth.py`.
3. Ensure that the authentication processes are integrated correctly within the project to secure user access.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** This file can be imported as a module to perform input validation for user authentication in a Node.js application.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies are required for this file.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticate a user and return a session token.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: End a user session based on the session token.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Check if a session token is valid and the user is authenticated.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to manage user authentication. Call `register_user` to add new users, `login` to authenticate users and get a session token, `logout` to end a session, and `is_authenticated` to check if a session is valid.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For handling dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For time-based calculations.
- `typing`: For type hints.
