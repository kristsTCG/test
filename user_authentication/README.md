# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It includes a JavaScript file for validation and a Python file for handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files, `validator.js` for client-side validation and `auth.py` for server-side authentication.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation logic for user inputs. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets specified criteria before submission.
   
2. **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for server-side authentication processes. It handles user login, registration, and authentication against the system's database.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - To use the validation logic in `validator.js`, include the file in your HTML document using a script tag.
   - Call the validation functions provided in `validator.js` on user input fields to validate data before form submission.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Import `auth.py` in your Python project to access the authentication functionalities.
   - Utilize the functions defined in `auth.py` to handle user authentication tasks such as login, registration, and user session management.

Ensure that you follow the guidelines and best practices defined in each file to maintain secure and efficient user authentication processes in your project.
