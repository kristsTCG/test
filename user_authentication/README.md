2. `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters, handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Purpose**: Validates user input data to ensure it meets specified criteria.
- **Character Count**: 1212
- **Usage**: Used to validate user input such as email addresses, passwords, and other form data.

### auth.py
- **Purpose**: Manages user authentication processes such as login, registration, and password reset.
- **Character Count**: 2198
- **Usage**: Contains functions for user authentication, token generation, and password hashing.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality provided by `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code and call the necessary validation functions with the required parameters.
