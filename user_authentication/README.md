# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication logic within the system.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Utilize the functions in `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing it further.
2. Implement the authentication logic provided in `auth.py` to manage user authentication processes within the project.
3. Ensure to maintain the integrity of the authentication system by following the guidelines and logic defined in these files.
