# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles tasks such as validating user input and managing user authentication using JavaScript and Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate the validation logic (validator.js) written in JavaScript and the authentication logic (auth.py) written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains the validation logic for user input. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
- **auth.py**: This file handles user authentication using Python. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the system.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to match the project's requirements.
   - Include the `validator.js` file in the appropriate modules that require user input validation.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Implement additional authentication features such as two-factor authentication or password reset functionality.
   - Integrate the `auth.py` file with other parts of the project that require user authentication.

Ensure to test the user authentication functionalities thoroughly to maintain the security and integrity of the system.
