# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: Responsible for validating user input data.
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Language: JavaScript

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Manages user authentication processes.
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Language: Python

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionality in this folder:
1. Review `validator.js` for input validation logic and make necessary modifications.
2. Examine `auth.py` to understand the authentication processes and customize them as needed.
3. Integrate these files into your project's authentication flow to enhance user security and access control.
