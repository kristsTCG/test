# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling the authentication process. It manages user authentication, login, and logout functionalities within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the code in this folder effectively:
- Use `validator.js` for validating user input data before proceeding with authentication processes.
- Utilize `auth.py` for implementing user authentication, login, and logout functionalities in the project.
