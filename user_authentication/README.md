# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It ensures that the data entered by the user meets the required criteria before submission.
- **auth.py**: This file handles server-side authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication using Python.

## Usage
1. To utilize the client-side validation provided by `validator.js`, include this file in your HTML file using a script tag.
   ```html
   <script src="user_authentication/validator.js"></script>
   ```
2. Use the functions defined in `validator.js` to validate user input before submitting forms.
3. To implement server-side authentication, import `auth.py` in your Python project and utilize the functions provided for user authentication tasks.
