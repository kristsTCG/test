# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains code for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication logic. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in the `user_authentication` folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file for validation rules and customize them according to project requirements.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to understand the authentication logic implemented and make necessary adjustments based on project specifications.
3. Integrate these files into the project's authentication system as per the project's architecture and requirements.
