# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate the validation logic in `validator.js` (JavaScript) and the authentication logic in `auth.py` (Python).

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains the logic for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria.
- `auth.py`: This Python file is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication using secure methods.

## Usage
1. To work with the validation logic, refer to `validator.js` and integrate its functions into the relevant parts of the project where user input validation is required.
2. For user authentication processes, utilize the functions defined in `auth.py` to handle user login, registration, and authentication securely.

Ensure that any modifications or integrations with these files follow the project's coding standards and security guidelines.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates a password based on length and character requirements.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates a username for length and character restrictions.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character complexity.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token for active sessions.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by removing the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to access user authentication functionalities.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints (not used in this file).
