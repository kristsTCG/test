# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files, `validator.js` for client-side validation written in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication logic written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It ensures that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submission.
   
2. `auth.py`: This file contains server-side authentication logic for verifying user credentials and managing user sessions. It handles the authentication process securely on the server side.

## Usage
1. To use the client-side validation provided by `validator.js`, include the script in your HTML file using `<script src="path/to/validator.js"></script>`. Then, call the validation functions as needed in your front-end code.

2. For server-side authentication using `auth.py`, import the file in your Python project and utilize the authentication functions provided. Ensure to configure the necessary endpoints and integrate the authentication logic with your application's user management system.
