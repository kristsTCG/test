# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It includes functions for user login, registration, and authentication checks.

## Usage
To utilize the functionality provided in this folder:
1. Use the functions defined in `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing it for authentication.
2. Incorporate the functions from `auth.py` to manage user authentication processes within the project.
3. Ensure that the authentication logic is integrated seamlessly with other parts of the project that require user authentication.
