## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes the following key components:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters that handles user input validation.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters responsible for user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file is crucial for validating user input data. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is essential for handling user authentication within the project. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes to ensure secure access to the system.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
