# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` consists of two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters, responsible for user input validation.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters, managing user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Role**: Handles user input validation.
- **Size**: 1212 characters
- **Usage**: Ensures that user input meets specified criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.

### auth.py
- **Role**: Manages user authentication processes.
- **Size**: 2198 characters
- **Usage**: Handles user login, registration, and authentication tasks within the application.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality, refer to `validator.js`. Modify the validation criteria as needed to suit the project requirements.
2. For user authentication tasks, interact with `auth.py`. Implement login, registration, and authentication logic based on the project's authentication flow.

Ensure to maintain the integrity of the authentication processes and adhere to security best practices when working with the code in this folder.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.

- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticate a user and return a session token.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: End a user session based on the session token.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Check if a session token is valid and the user is authenticated.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For working with JSON data.
- `datetime`: For handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
