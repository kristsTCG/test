# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It includes functions for user login, registration, and authentication checks.

## Usage
To utilize the functionality provided by the `user_authentication` folder, follow these steps:
1. Use the functions defined in `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing it further.
2. Utilize the functions in `auth.py` to manage user authentication tasks such as user login, registration, and authentication checks.
3. Ensure that both files are integrated into the project where user authentication is required.
4. Refer to the specific functions within each file for detailed usage instructions and parameters.
