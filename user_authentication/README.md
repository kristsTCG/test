# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input data related to authentication processes.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file is 2198 characters long and contains the authentication logic for verifying user credentials and managing user sessions.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder, developers can refer to the `validator.js` file for user input validation and the `auth.py` file for user authentication tasks. Ensure that the code is integrated correctly with the rest of the project to maintain secure user authentication processes.
