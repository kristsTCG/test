# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains code for validating user input related to authentication. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling the authentication logic. It manages user authentication processes such as login, logout, and session management.

## Usage
To utilize the code in this folder effectively:
- Review `validator.js` to understand the validation rules for user input.
- Explore `auth.py` to grasp the authentication logic implemented in Python.
- Integrate these files into the project's authentication system as needed.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if a password meets certain criteria (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username (3-20 characters, alphanumeric and underscores only).
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file and use its static methods for input validation tasks.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticate a user and return a session token.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: End a user session based on the session token.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Check if a session token is valid and the user is authenticated.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to use the provided user authentication functionalities.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For time duration calculations.
- `typing.Optional`: For type hinting.
