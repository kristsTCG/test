# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder consists of two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file containing functions for validating user input. It is 1212 characters long.
- `auth.py`: A Python file responsible for handling user authentication processes. It is 2198 characters long.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file contains functions for validating user input, ensuring data integrity and security within the authentication process.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file manages user authentication functionalities such as login, registration, and password reset. It plays a crucial role in securing user accounts and ensuring authorized access.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code and call the necessary functions to validate user input.
2. For user authentication processes, import and utilize the functions defined in `auth.py` within your Python code. This includes handling user login, registration, and password reset functionalities.

Ensure to follow best practices for user authentication and input validation to maintain the security and integrity of user data.

- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric characters and underscores within a specified length range.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py
