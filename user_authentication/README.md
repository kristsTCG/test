# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for authentication logic.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input to ensure data integrity and security.
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file handles user authentication processes such as login, registration, and session management.

## Usage
1. To utilize the input validation functionalities, refer to the `validator.js` file and import the necessary functions into your JavaScript code.
2. For user authentication tasks, interact with the `auth.py` file in Python. Implement the provided functions for user login, registration, and session handling as needed in your project.

if (InputValidator.validateEmail('example@email.com')) {
    // Email is valid
}
```

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py
