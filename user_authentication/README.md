## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: Responsible for validating user input data.
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Language: JavaScript

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Manages user authentication processes.
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Language: Python

## Usage
1. **validator.js**
   - To use the validator, import the `validator.js` file into your JavaScript code.
   - Utilize the validation functions provided in `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing.

2. **auth.py**
   - Import the `auth.py` file into your Python code to access authentication functionalities.
   - Use the methods defined in `auth.py` to authenticate users and manage user sessions securely.

Ensure to follow the guidelines and best practices documented within each file for seamless integration and usage of the user authentication features provided in this folder.
