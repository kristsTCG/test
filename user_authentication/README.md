# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input such as email addresses, passwords, and other user-related data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring data integrity and security in the authentication process.

2. **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication logic. It includes functions for user login, registration, password hashing, and token generation. This file is essential for managing user authentication within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation functions available for user input.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to grasp the authentication logic implemented for user registration, login, and token generation.
3. Integrate these files into your project as needed for user authentication purposes.
4. Ensure to adhere to the coding standards and practices followed in these files for consistency and maintainability.
