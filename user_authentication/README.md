   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Language: Python

## Usage
1. **validator.js**
   - To use the validation functionality, import `validator.js` into your JavaScript file.
   - Utilize the validation functions provided within `validator.js` to validate user input before processing it further.

2. **auth.py**
   - Import `auth.py` into your Python script to access the authentication logic.
   - Use the functions defined in `auth.py` to authenticate users based on the project's requirements.
