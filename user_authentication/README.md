# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**:
   - Language: JavaScript
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Role: Responsible for validating user input data to ensure it meets the required criteria for authentication.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Language: Python
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Role: Manages the authentication processes for users, including login, registration, and session management.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - To use the validation functions provided in `validator.js`, import the module into your JavaScript files using `require` or `import`.
   - Call the appropriate validation functions as needed in your authentication logic to validate user input data.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Import the `auth` module into your Python files to access the authentication functionalities.
   - Utilize the provided functions in `auth.py` for user registration, login, and session management within your application.

Ensure to follow the documentation within each file for specific usage instructions and function details.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** User authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Register a new user with username, email, and password.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticate user and return a session token.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: End a user session.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Import the `UserAuth` class and use its methods for user registration, login, logout, and session validation.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
