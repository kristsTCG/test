# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` for client-side validation written in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user data is correctly formatted before submission.
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file handles server-side authentication processes. It is responsible for verifying user credentials and managing user sessions securely.

## Usage
To utilize the functionality provided in this folder:
1. Use `validator.js` for client-side validation by including it in your HTML files and calling its functions to validate user input.
2. Incorporate `auth.py` into your server-side code to handle user authentication processes. Ensure that it is properly configured and integrated with your application's authentication flow.
