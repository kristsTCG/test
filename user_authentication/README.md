# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Type: JavaScript
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Role: Responsible for validating user input data to ensure it meets the required criteria for authentication.

2. **auth.py**
   - Type: Python
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Role: Manages the authentication process, including user login, registration, and session management.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality, refer to `validator.js` and integrate its methods into your user input validation process.
   
2. For user authentication tasks such as login and registration, utilize the functions provided in `auth.py`. Ensure to handle session management as per the project requirements.

3. Maintain the integrity and security of user authentication data by following best practices and updating the authentication logic as needed.
