# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It includes functions for user login, registration, and authentication checks.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file for validation functions and ensure they are integrated into the user input validation process.
2. Utilize the functions in `auth.py` for user authentication tasks such as login, registration, and authentication checks.
3. Ensure that the logic in both files aligns with the project's user authentication requirements and integrates seamlessly with other components.
