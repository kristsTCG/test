# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` contains two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters that handles user input validation.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters that manages user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Role**: Responsible for validating user input data.
- **Character count**: 1212
- **Usage**: Ensures that user-provided data meets specified criteria before processing.

### auth.py
- **Role**: Manages user authentication processes.
- **Character count**: 2198
- **Usage**: Handles user login, registration, and authentication logic.

## Usage
1. To use the validation functionality provided by `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code and call the appropriate validation functions as needed.
2. For user authentication processes, utilize the functions and logic defined in `auth.py` by importing the file into your Python code and invoking the necessary methods.

Ensure that you follow the specific guidelines and APIs defined within each file for seamless integration and functionality within the project.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file contains input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username inputs, as well as determining the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username, allowing only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes the password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates the user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends the user session based on the session token.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if the session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: Used for hashing passwords.
- `json`: Not used in this file but imported.
- `datetime`: Used for handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: Used for calculating expiration time for sessions.
- `typing`: Used for type hinting.
