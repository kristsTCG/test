# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python. These files are responsible for validating user input and managing user authentication, respectively.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file consists of 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.

2. **auth.py**: This Python file contains 2198 characters and is crucial for handling user authentication within the project. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes to ensure secure access to the system.

## Usage
To utilize the code in this folder effectively, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation criteria for user input data.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to comprehend the user authentication processes implemented in the project.
3. Integrate these files into the relevant parts of the project where user authentication is required.
4. Ensure to maintain the security and integrity of user data throughout the authentication processes.

- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the provided validation functions in user authentication processes.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session by invalidating the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** To use this file, create an instance of `UserAuth` and call its methods for user registration, login, logout, and authentication.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: for hashing passwords.
- `json`: for JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: for handling date and time.
- `timedelta`: for calculating time differences.
- `typing`: for type hints.
