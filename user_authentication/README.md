# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python. These files handle user input validation and authentication logic respectively.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This file contains functions for validating user input such as email addresses, passwords, and other form data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It includes functions for user login, registration, password hashing, and token generation. `auth.py` is essential for securing user accounts and managing user sessions.

## Usage
To utilize the functionality provided by the `user_authentication` folder, follow these steps:
1. Use the functions defined in `validator.js` to validate user input before processing it further.
2. Import and utilize the functions from `auth.py` to implement user authentication features such as login, registration, and password management.
3. Ensure that the authentication logic is integrated seamlessly with other parts of the project that require user authentication.
