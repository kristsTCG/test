# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
  
- `auth.py`: This Python file handles the authentication logic for users. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the system.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - To use the validation functions provided in `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code.
   - Call the necessary validation functions on user input data to ensure it meets the required criteria.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Import `auth.py` into your Python code to access the authentication functionalities.
   - Utilize the functions within `auth.py` to handle user login, registration, and authentication processes in your application.

Ensure to follow the documentation within each file for specific usage instructions and function details.
