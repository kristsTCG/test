# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles tasks such as validating user input and managing user authentication using JavaScript and Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate the validation logic (validator.js) written in JavaScript and the authentication logic (auth.py) written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains the validation logic for user input. It ensures that the data entered by the user meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
- **auth.py**: The auth.py file handles user authentication processes using Python. It manages user login, registration, and authentication within the system.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - To use the validation functions in validator.js, import the file into your JavaScript code.
   - Call the appropriate validation functions provided in the file to validate user input before processing it further.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Import the auth.py file into your Python code to access the authentication functionalities.
   - Utilize the functions within auth.py to handle user registration, login, and authentication processes in your application.

Ensure to follow the documentation within each file for specific usage instructions and function details.
