- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

```javascript
const InputValidator = require('./validator.js');

if (InputValidator.validateEmail('example@email.com')) {
    // Email is valid
}

const passwordStrength = InputValidator.getPasswordStrength('StrongPassword123');
