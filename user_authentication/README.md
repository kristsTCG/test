## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` contains two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters, responsible for input validation.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters, responsible for user authentication logic.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- Role: Handles input validation for user authentication.
- Size: 1212 characters
- Language: JavaScript

### auth.py
- Role: Manages user authentication processes.
- Size: 2198 characters
- Language: Python

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionality provided in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Use the `validator.js` file for validating user input before authentication processes.
2. Utilize the `auth.py` file for handling user authentication logic within your project.
3. Ensure to integrate these files into your project's authentication flow for secure user authentication.
