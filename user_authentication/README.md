# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submission.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python file handles server-side authentication processes. It manages user authentication, login, and access control within the application.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to suit the project requirements.
   - Integrate the validation functions with user input forms to ensure data integrity.
   
2. **auth.py**:
   - Configure authentication settings such as session management and password hashing.
   - Implement user authentication logic based on the project's authentication requirements.
   - Utilize the provided functions for user login, logout, and access control.

Ensure to maintain consistency between client-side and server-side validation to enhance security and user experience.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication processes. Call the provided methods to register users, log in, log out, and check authentication status.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
