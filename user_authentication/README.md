## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes the following key components:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file containing functions for validating user input data.
- `auth.py`: A Python file responsible for handling user authentication logic.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Role**: Provides functions for validating user input data.
- **Size**: 1212 characters
- **Usage**: Used to ensure that user-provided data meets specified criteria before processing.

### auth.py
- **Role**: Manages user authentication processes.
- **Size**: 2198 characters
- **Usage**: Implements authentication logic such as user login, registration, and access control.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Use the functions in `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing.
2. Utilize the functionalities in `auth.py` for user authentication tasks such as login, registration, and access control.

Ensure that you understand the logic implemented in `auth.py` to effectively manage user authentication in the project.
