# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for authentication logic.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains functions to validate user input, ensuring data integrity and security.
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file handles user authentication processes, such as login, registration, and session management.

## Usage
1. To use the validation functions provided in `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code and call the necessary functions to validate user input.
2. For user authentication tasks, utilize the functions defined in `auth.py` by importing the file into your Python code. Implement the authentication logic as needed for login, registration, and session handling.

Ensure to follow best practices for user authentication and input validation to maintain security and data integrity within the project.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Evaluates the strength of a password and returns a descriptive level.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file provides a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that handles user authentication operations.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by invalidating the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to access user authentication functionalities like registering users, logging in, logging out, and checking authentication status.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints (not used in this file).
