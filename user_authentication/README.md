# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This module handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains logic for validating user inputs and ensuring data integrity during the authentication process.
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` manages user authentication tasks such as login, logout, and user session management.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation logic implemented for user inputs.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to understand the authentication functionalities provided.
3. Use the functions and methods defined in these files to implement user authentication features in the project.
