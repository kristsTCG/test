# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` contains two key files: `validator.js` and `auth.py`. These files are responsible for handling user input validation and authentication logic, respectively.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for managing user authentication within the project. It handles user login, registration, and authentication processes to ensure secure access to the system.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in the `user_authentication` folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation logic implemented for user input data.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to understand how user authentication processes are managed within the project.
3. Integrate these files into the relevant parts of the project where user authentication functionalities are required.
4. Ensure to follow any specific guidelines or documentation within the files for proper implementation and usage.
