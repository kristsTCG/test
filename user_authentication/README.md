# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` for client-side input validation written in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication logic written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: Responsible for client-side input validation.
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Language: JavaScript

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Handles server-side authentication processes.
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Language: Python

## Usage
1. **validator.js**
   - Ensure the `validator.js` file is linked in your HTML file where user input validation is required.
   - Customize the validation rules as needed for your project by modifying the functions in the file.

2. **auth.py**
   - Integrate the `auth.py` file with your server-side codebase to handle user authentication.
   - Utilize the functions provided in `auth.py` for user login, registration, and authentication processes.

By following the guidelines above, you can effectively utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in the `user_authentication` folder of the project.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token if successful.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the session token.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** To use this file, create an instance of `UserAuth` and call its methods for user registration, login, logout, and session validation.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
