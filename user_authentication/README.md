# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
- `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication logic. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation criteria for user input.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to grasp the user authentication processes implemented in the project.
3. Integrate these files into your project as needed for user authentication functionalities.
