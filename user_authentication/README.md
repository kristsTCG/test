# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling the authentication process. It includes functions for user login, registration, and authentication logic.

## Usage
To utilize the functionality provided in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules applied to user input.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to familiarize yourself with the authentication logic and functions available.
3. Integrate these files into your project to enable user authentication features.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is between 3-20 characters, alphanumeric, and underscores only.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of the input password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** User authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class managing user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token if successful.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the session token.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to utilize user authentication functionalities like registration, login, logout, and session validation.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For representing a duration of time.
- `typing.Optional`: For type hinting optional return values.
- `typing.Dict`: For type hinting dictionary structures.
