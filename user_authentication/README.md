# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python file handles the authentication logic for users. It includes functions for user login, registration, and authentication checks. 

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Import the `validator.js` file into your JavaScript code.
   - Utilize the validation functions provided to validate user input data before processing it further.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Import the `auth.py` file into your Python project.
   - Use the functions within `auth.py` to implement user authentication features such as login, registration, and authentication checks.

Ensure that you follow the coding standards and guidelines set within the project when working with the code in this folder.
