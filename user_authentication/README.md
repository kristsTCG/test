# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It includes functions for user login, registration, and authentication.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation logic implemented for user input data.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to familiarize yourself with the user authentication processes.
3. Integrate the validation and authentication functions into your project as needed.
4. Ensure to handle errors and exceptions appropriately to maintain the security of the authentication system.
