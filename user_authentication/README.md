# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input related to authentication. It ensures that the data entered by users meets the required criteria for authentication processes.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file, with 2198 characters, handles the authentication logic for users. It manages user login, registration, and other authentication-related tasks within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the functionality provided in this folder, developers can refer to the `validator.js` file for implementing user input validation in JavaScript. Similarly, the `auth.py` file can be used for handling user authentication processes in Python. Developers should ensure proper integration of these files with the rest of the project to enable secure and efficient user authentication.

- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Assesses the strength of a password based on various criteria.

**Usage:** This file can be imported as a module to perform input validation functions in a user authentication system.

**Dependencies:** None

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password()`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user()`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login()`: Method to authenticate a user with username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout()`: Method to end a user's session based on the session token.
- `is_authenticated()`: Method to check if a session token is valid and the user is authenticated.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication in your application.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
