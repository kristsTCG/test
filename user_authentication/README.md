## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes JavaScript and Python files for different aspects of user authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication logic. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionality provided in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules applied to user input.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to understand how user authentication processes are implemented in Python.
3. Integrate these files into your project as needed to enable user authentication features.
4. Ensure that any modifications or additions align with the existing authentication logic to maintain system security and functionality.
