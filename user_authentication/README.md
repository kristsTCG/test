# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes a JavaScript file for validation (`validator.js`) and a Python file for authentication (`auth.py`).

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
- `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It includes functions for user login, registration, and authentication checks.

## Usage
1. To use the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code and call the necessary functions to validate user input.
2. For user authentication tasks, import `auth.py` into your Python code. Utilize the functions provided within `auth.py` for user login, registration, and authentication checks.

Remember to handle errors and exceptions appropriately when working with the user authentication functionalities in this folder.
