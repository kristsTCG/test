# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. It is responsible for validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input related to authentication, such as email addresses and passwords.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python file contains 2198 characters and handles the authentication logic, including user login, registration, and token generation.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules for user input.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to understand how user authentication processes are handled.
3. Modify the code as needed to customize authentication functionality for your project.
4. Ensure to test any changes thoroughly to maintain secure user authentication processes.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric and underscore characters.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength level of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by removing the session token from active sessions.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and not expired.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations. Call methods like `register_user`, `login`, `logout`, and `is_authenticated` as needed.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib` for hashing functions.
- `json` for JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime` for working with dates and times.
- `timedelta` for calculating time differences.
- `typing` for type hints.
