# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It includes a JavaScript file for validation logic and a Python file for handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is structured to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` for client-side validation and `auth.py` for server-side authentication.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file (1212 characters) is responsible for client-side validation of user input data. It ensures that the data entered by the user meets the required criteria before submission.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file (2198 characters) manages server-side authentication processes. It handles user login, registration, password hashing, and authentication checks to ensure secure access to the application.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - To use the validation logic in this file, include it in your HTML file using `<script src="path/to/validator.js"></script>`.
   - Call the validation functions provided in this file on form submission events to validate user input data.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Import the `auth` module in your Python application by using `from user_authentication import auth`.
   - Utilize the functions defined in this file for user authentication tasks such as login, registration, and password management.
   - Ensure to configure the necessary database connections and settings as per your project requirements.

By following the guidelines provided in the key files, you can effectively implement user authentication features in your project using the code within the `user_authentication` folder.

- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numeric characters.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username allowing only alphanumeric characters and underscores within a specific length range.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character complexity.

**Usage:** This file can be imported into other JavaScript files using `require` or `import` statements to utilize the input validation functions provided.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies required for this file.
