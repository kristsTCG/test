# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This folder handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes the following key components:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file containing functions for validating user input data.
- `auth.py`: A Python file responsible for handling user authentication logic.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- Role: This file contains functions to validate user input data, ensuring data integrity and security.
- Size: 1212 characters
- Language: JavaScript

### auth.py
- Role: This file manages user authentication processes, such as login, registration, and access control.
- Size: 2198 characters
- Language: Python

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the necessary functions into your JavaScript files.
2. Use the functions provided in `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing it further.
3. In `auth.py`, implement the authentication logic for user registration, login, and access control based on the project requirements.
4. Ensure to maintain the integrity and security of user authentication processes by following best practices outlined in the code files.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username, allowing alphanumeric characters and underscores within a specific length range.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character complexity, returning a descriptive strength level.

**Usage:** This file can be imported into other JavaScript files using `require` or `import` statements to access the input validation functions.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication in a Python application.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib` for hashing functions.
- `json` for JSON serialization.
- `datetime` for handling date and time.
- `timedelta` for time duration calculations.
- `typing` for type hints.
