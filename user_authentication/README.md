# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for authentication logic.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input such as email addresses, passwords, and other user-related data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring data integrity and security.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python file handles user authentication processes such as login, logout, and session management. It interacts with the database to verify user credentials and manage user sessions.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the necessary functions into your JavaScript files and call them as needed to validate user input before processing.
   
2. For user authentication tasks, import the `auth.py` module into your Python scripts. Use the provided functions to authenticate users, manage sessions, and handle login/logout operations as required by your application.

3. Ensure to follow best practices for user authentication and input validation to enhance the security and reliability of your application.

- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length and character requirements.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username allowing only alphanumeric characters and underscores within a specific length range.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character complexity.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies required.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class managing user authentication operations.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** To use this file, create an instance of the `UserAuth` class and call its methods for user registration, login, logout, and session validation.

**Dependencies:** This file imports `hashlib`, `json`, `datetime`, `timedelta`, and `Optional` and `Dict` types from `typing`.
