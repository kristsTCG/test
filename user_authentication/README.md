# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. It is responsible for validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` and `auth.py`.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Type: JavaScript
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Role: Responsible for validating user input data for authentication purposes.

2. **auth.py**
   - Type: Python
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Role: Handles user authentication processes, such as login, registration, and token generation.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**
   - Ensure the `validator.js` file is included in the appropriate modules that require user input validation.
   - Use the functions provided in `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing it for authentication.

2. **auth.py**
   - Import the `auth.py` file in modules where user authentication processes are required.
   - Utilize the functions defined in `auth.py` for user login, registration, and token generation tasks.

Remember to follow the coding standards and guidelines established for the project when working with the code in the `user_authentication` folder.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** User authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class managing user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Import `auth.py` and create an instance of `UserAuth` to utilize the user authentication functionalities.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For working with JSON data.
- `datetime`: For handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
