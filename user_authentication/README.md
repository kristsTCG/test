# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This module is responsible for validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side input validation and auth.py for server-side authentication logic.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation logic to ensure that user input meets specified criteria before submission.
- **auth.py**: The Python file auth.py handles server-side authentication processes, such as verifying user credentials and managing user sessions.

## Usage
1. To use the client-side validation feature, refer to `validator.js`. Customize validation rules as needed for your project requirements.
2. For server-side authentication tasks, utilize `auth.py`. Implement authentication logic, such as verifying user credentials against a database or external service.
3. Ensure to integrate both client-side and server-side components seamlessly to provide a secure and user-friendly authentication experience.
