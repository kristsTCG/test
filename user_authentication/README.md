# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It includes scripts for validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input data related to authentication. It ensures that the input meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file contains 2198 characters and handles the authentication logic within the project. It manages user authentication, login, and logout functionalities.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in the `user_authentication` folder, follow these steps:
1. Modify the `validator.js` file to customize the validation criteria for user input data.
2. Implement the authentication logic in the `auth.py` file according to the project requirements.
3. Ensure that the functions in both files are integrated correctly with other parts of the project that require user authentication.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively work with the code in the `user_authentication` folder to enhance user authentication processes in your project.

- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password.

**Usage:** To use this file, import it into your code using `const InputValidator = require('./validator.js');` and then call the validation functions as needed.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session by removing the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations like registration, login, and session handling.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For handling JSON data.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
