# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication operations efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: Responsible for validating user input data.
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Language: JavaScript

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Manages user authentication processes.
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Language: Python

## Usage
1. **validator.js**
   - Ensure that the `validator.js` file is properly integrated into the project.
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to suit the project requirements.
   - Use the functions provided in `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing.

2. **auth.py**
   - Integrate `auth.py` into the project to handle user authentication.
   - Customize the authentication logic to align with the project's security requirements.
   - Utilize the functions in `auth.py` to authenticate users and manage user sessions securely.

Ensure that both files are appropriately imported and utilized within the project to maintain a secure and efficient user authentication system.

- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username meets the specified criteria.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength level of a given password.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class where input validation is needed and call the respective validation functions or password strength function.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, logout, and session authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash passwords using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token for active sessions.

- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and not expired.

**Usage:** Import the `UserAuth` class from this file to handle user authentication in your Python application.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
