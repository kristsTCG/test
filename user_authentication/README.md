# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file contains 2198 characters and handles the authentication logic for users. It verifies user credentials and manages the authentication process.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionalities in this folder:
1. Modify the `validator.js` file to customize the validation rules according to project requirements.
2. Implement the authentication logic in the `auth.py` file to authenticate users securely.
3. Ensure that both files are integrated correctly with other parts of the project that require user authentication.

- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password and returns a descriptive level.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class where input validation is needed.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to manage user registration, login, logout, and session validation.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For time duration calculations.
- `typing`: For type hints.
