# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` for client-side input validation in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication logic in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic written in JavaScript. It ensures that user input meets specified criteria before submitting to the server for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file houses server-side authentication logic written in Python. It handles user authentication requests, verifies user credentials, and manages user sessions securely.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to suit the project requirements.
   - Include the `validator.js` file in your HTML pages using `<script>` tags.
   - Call the validation functions provided in this file on user input fields to validate user data before submission.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Implement additional authentication methods or customize the existing logic to align with your project's authentication requirements.
   - Integrate the authentication functionalities provided in `auth.py` with your server-side codebase to secure user authentication processes.

Ensure to test the user authentication functionalities thoroughly to maintain the security and integrity of user data in your project.
