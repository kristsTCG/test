# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder consists of two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters, responsible for validating user input data.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters, handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file is crucial for ensuring that user input data meets the required criteria and is safe for processing. It plays a significant role in maintaining data integrity and security within the authentication system.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is essential for managing user authentication processes within the project. It handles user login, registration, and authentication functionalities, ensuring secure access to the system.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided by the `user_authentication` folder, developers can refer to the following guidelines:
1. Use `validator.js` for validating user input data before processing it further in the system.
2. Implement the authentication logic provided in `auth.py` to manage user login, registration, and authentication processes effectively.

By following the structure and guidelines outlined in this folder documentation, developers can seamlessly integrate user authentication functionalities into the project.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username, allowing alphanumeric characters and underscores only.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token for active sessions.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by removing the session token from active sessions.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Import the `UserAuth` class from this file to implement user authentication in your Python application.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: Used for hashing passwords.
- `json`: Not used in this file but imported.
