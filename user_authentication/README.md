# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder consists of two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file containing code for user input validation. It is 1212 characters long.
- `auth.py`: A Python file responsible for user authentication logic. It is 2198 characters long.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file handles user input validation within the authentication process. It ensures that user-provided data meets specified criteria before proceeding with authentication.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file contains the core authentication logic for verifying user credentials and granting access to the system. It manages user login, logout, and session handling functionalities.

## Usage
To utilize the code in this folder:
1. Modify the validation criteria in `validator.js` as needed for your project's requirements.
2. Implement the authentication logic in `auth.py` to suit your application's authentication flow.
3. Ensure to integrate these files with other parts of the project that require user authentication functionalities.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and a number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is 3-20 characters long and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user authentication operations.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by invalidating the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication system. Call the methods `register_user`, `login`, `logout`, and `is_authenticated` as needed.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: for hashing passwords.
- `json`: for JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: for working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: for calculating time differences.
- `typing`: for type hints (not used in this file).
