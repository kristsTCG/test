# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. This module is responsible for validating user input and managing user authentication using both JavaScript and Python.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` contains the following files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters that handles user input validation.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters that manages user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file contains functions for validating user input, ensuring data integrity and security in the authentication process.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is crucial for managing user authentication in the project. It handles user login, registration, and authentication processes using Python.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the necessary functions into your JavaScript files and call them as needed to validate user input.

2. In Python scripts that require user authentication functionalities, import the `auth.py` module and utilize its functions for user login, registration, and authentication processes.

3. Ensure that the functions in both files are used appropriately to maintain the security and integrity of user authentication processes in the project.

- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric and underscore characters.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on various criteria.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py
