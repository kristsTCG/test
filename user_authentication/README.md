# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input data for authentication purposes.
- `auth.py`: This Python file contains 2198 characters and manages the authentication process for users within the system.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand how user input data is validated.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to comprehend the authentication process for users.
3. Integrate these files into your project to enable user authentication features.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric and underscore characters.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength level of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality. It allows users to register, login, logout, and check authentication status.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user authentication operations.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Method to register a new user.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Method to authenticate a user and return a session token.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Method to end a user session.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to use the authentication system. Call the methods `register_user`, `login`, `logout`, and `is_authenticated` as needed.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: Used for hashing passwords.
- `json`: Imported but not used in the provided code snippet.
- `datetime`: Used for working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: Used for calculating time differences.
- `typing.Optional`: Used for type hinting in function definitions.
- `typing.Dict`: Used for type hinting in function definitions.
