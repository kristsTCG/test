# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This module handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side validation and auth.py for server-side authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring data integrity and security on the client side.
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for server-side authentication processes. It manages user authentication, session handling, and access control within the application.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed for user input fields.
   - Include this file in your HTML templates using `<script>` tags to enable client-side validation.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Integrate the authentication logic into your server-side codebase.
   - Use the functions provided in `auth.py` to authenticate users, manage sessions, and control access to protected resources.

Ensure that both client-side and server-side authentication mechanisms work seamlessly together to provide a secure user authentication experience.
