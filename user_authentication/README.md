# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
- `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling the authentication logic. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the system.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
1. Modify the `validator.js` file to customize the validation rules according to project requirements.
2. Use the functions defined in `auth.py` to implement user authentication features in the project.
3. Ensure that both files are integrated correctly with other components that interact with user authentication processes.
