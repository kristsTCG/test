# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` contains two key files:
- validator.js: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters responsible for validating user input.
- auth.py: A Python file with 2198 characters handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file is crucial for validating user input in the authentication process. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is essential for handling user authentication within the project. It contains the logic for verifying user credentials and managing user sessions.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Modify the `validator.js` file to customize input validation rules as needed.
2. Use the functions defined in `auth.py` to authenticate users and manage user sessions within the project.
