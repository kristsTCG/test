# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes scripts for validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. **auth.py**: The Python script `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication functionalities within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in the `user_authentication` folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation logic and criteria for user input.
2. Explore the `auth.py` script to familiarize yourself with the user authentication processes implemented in Python.
3. Integrate the validation and authentication functions from these files into your project as needed.
4. Ensure to maintain the integrity and security of user authentication procedures while customizing them for your specific project requirements.
