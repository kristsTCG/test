# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication features efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side validation and auth.py for server-side authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It ensures that user-provided data meets specified criteria before submission.
- **auth.py**: This Python file is responsible for server-side authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication against stored credentials.

## Usage
1. Utilize `validator.js` to implement client-side validation for user input forms.
2. Incorporate `auth.py` to handle server-side authentication tasks such as user login and registration.
3. Ensure proper integration of both files to establish a secure and reliable user authentication system.
