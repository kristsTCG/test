# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to include two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python. These files are responsible for implementing the user authentication logic.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It includes functions for user login, registration, and authentication.

## Usage
To utilize the code in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation logic and criteria for user input data.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to understand the user authentication processes such as login, registration, and authentication.
3. Integrate these files into the project's authentication system as needed.
4. Ensure to maintain the integrity of user data and security protocols while implementing these authentication functionalities.
