# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes validation logic in JavaScript and authentication logic in Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication processes. It contains two key files, `validator.js` for input validation and `auth.py` for user authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains logic for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication within the system.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed for user input fields.
   - Import and use the validation functions in other parts of the project where input validation is required.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Implement additional authentication logic as per project requirements.
   - Integrate the authentication functions with other parts of the system that require user authentication.

Ensure to test the functionality of both files thoroughly to maintain a secure and reliable user authentication system.

**Usage:** This file can be imported as a module to perform input validation for user authentication.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
