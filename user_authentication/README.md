# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate the validation logic in JavaScript and the authentication logic in Python. This separation allows for clear maintenance and scalability of the authentication system.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains the user validation logic, ensuring that user input meets specified criteria before proceeding with authentication.
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes, such as verifying user credentials and generating authentication tokens.

## Usage
1. To work with the user validation logic, refer to `validator.js`. Modify the validation criteria as needed to suit the project requirements.
2. For user authentication tasks, utilize `auth.py`. Implement functions to authenticate users, handle login/logout processes, and manage authentication tokens.

Ensure to maintain the separation of concerns between user validation and authentication processes to keep the codebase organized and maintainable.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numeric characters.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username, allowing alphanumeric characters and underscores only.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class where needed and call the validation functions as required.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies required.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** User authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to handle user authentication operations.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Register a new user with username, email, and password.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticate user and return a session token.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: End a user session.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to manage user authentication. Call `register_user` to add a new user, `login` to authenticate and get a session token, `logout` to end a session, and `is_authenticated` to check session validity.

**Dependencies:** `hashlib`, `json`, `datetime`, `timedelta`, `Optional`, `Dict`.
