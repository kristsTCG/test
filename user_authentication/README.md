# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling the authentication process. It includes functions for user login, registration, and authentication checks.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file for validation functions and customize them as needed for your project.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to understand the authentication logic and integrate it with your application's user management system.
3. Ensure that the functions in both files are appropriately called and integrated into your project's authentication flow.

By following these steps, you can effectively implement user authentication features using the code in this folder.
