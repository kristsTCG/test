# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication tasks within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in the `user_authentication` folder, follow these steps:
1. Use the functions defined in `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing it further.
2. Incorporate the authentication logic from `auth.py` to manage user login, registration, and authentication processes in the project.
3. Ensure that the code in these files is integrated correctly with other components of the project that require user authentication functionalities.
