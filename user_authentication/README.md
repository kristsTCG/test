# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user inputs and ensuring data integrity during the authentication process.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file consists of 2198 characters and manages the authentication logic, including user login, registration, and token generation.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules and implement custom validation logic if needed.
2. Study the `auth.py` file to grasp the authentication flow and integrate it with the rest of the project's user management system.
3. Ensure to follow best practices for user authentication and security when working with the code in this folder.
