# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` for client-side input validation using JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication logic using Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation functions to ensure that user input meets specified criteria before submission.
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file handles server-side authentication processes, such as verifying user credentials and managing user sessions.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation functions as needed to suit the project's requirements.
   - Include the `validator.js` file in your HTML templates using `<script>` tags.
   - Call the validation functions on user input fields to validate user input before form submission.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Customize the authentication logic to integrate with your project's user management system.
   - Import and use the functions defined in `auth.py` in your server-side code to authenticate users.
   - Ensure proper error handling and security measures are in place to protect user data during authentication processes.
