# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes validation logic in JavaScript and authentication logic in Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks. It contains two key files, `validator.js` for input validation and `auth.py` for user authentication.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains logic for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file handles user authentication processes. It includes functions for verifying user credentials and managing user sessions.

## Usage
1. To use the validation logic in `validator.js`, import the necessary functions and call them with the input data to validate user inputs.
   
2. For user authentication tasks, utilize the functions provided in `auth.py` to authenticate users, verify credentials, and manage user sessions within the project.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and a number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is between 3-20 characters long and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on its length and character composition.

**Usage:** This file can be imported as a module in other JavaScript files using `require` or `import` statements, and the functions can be called directly with the appropriate inputs.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user authentication operations.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** To use this authentication system, create an instance of `UserAuth` and call its methods for registration, login, logout, and authentication checks.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hinting.
