# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` for client-side input validation written in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication logic written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic to ensure that user input meets specified criteria before submission. It plays a crucial role in enhancing the user experience by providing real-time feedback on input errors.

2. **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is responsible for handling server-side authentication processes. It manages user authentication, login, and logout functionalities, ensuring secure access to the application.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**: To use the validation logic provided in `validator.js`, include the file in your HTML document using a script tag. You can then call the validation functions defined within this file to validate user input fields before form submission.

2. **auth.py**: Incorporate the authentication logic from `auth.py` into your server-side codebase. Utilize the functions defined in this file to authenticate users, handle login requests, and manage user sessions securely.

Ensure that both client-side and server-side authentication processes are in sync to provide a seamless and secure user authentication experience.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the format of a password (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username (3-20 characters, alphanumeric and underscores only).
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**

  - `logout`: Method to end a user session by invalidating the session token.
  - `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
