# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input data related to authentication. It ensures that the data entered by the user meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file is 2198 characters long and handles the authentication process for users. It verifies user credentials and grants access to authorized users.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionality in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules for user input data.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to understand the authentication process and how user credentials are verified.
3. Integrate these files into your project to enable secure user authentication mechanisms.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and a number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is 3-20 characters long, alphanumeric, and contains underscores only.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of the input password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication process.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file provides a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token for active sessions.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by removing the session token from active sessions.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and has not expired.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For handling JSON data.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
