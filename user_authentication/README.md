# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for authentication processes.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This file contains functions for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file handles user authentication logic. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the project.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Use the functions defined in `validator.js` to validate user input before processing it further.
2. Utilize the authentication logic implemented in `auth.py` to manage user authentication tasks such as login and registration.

Ensure that you understand the functions and methods defined in these files to effectively implement user authentication features in the project.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username inputs, as well as determining the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numeric characters.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username, allowing only alphanumeric characters and underscores within a specific length range.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and the presence of different character types.

**Usage:** This file can be imported into other JavaScript files using `require` or `import` statements to access the input validation functions provided by the `InputValidator` class.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password, returning a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session based on the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and still active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
