## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized with two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file containing functions for validating user input. (1212 characters)
- `auth.py`: A Python file responsible for handling user authentication processes. (2198 characters)

## Key Files
### 1. validator.js
- **Role**: Handles validation of user input data.
- **Character Count**: 1212
- **Usage**: Ensure that user-provided data meets specified criteria before processing.

### 2. auth.py
- **Role**: Manages user authentication processes.
- **Character Count**: 2198
- **Usage**: Handles user login, registration, and authentication tasks within the system.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the necessary functions into your JavaScript files and call them as needed to validate user input.
2. For user authentication tasks, import `auth.py` into your Python scripts and utilize the provided functions for user login, registration, and authentication processes.

- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file and use its static methods for input validation and password strength calculation.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py
