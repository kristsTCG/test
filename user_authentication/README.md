# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user inputs and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for authentication logic.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This file contains functions to validate user inputs, ensuring data integrity and security.
2. **auth.py**: This file handles user authentication processes such as login, registration, and password management.

## Usage
To utilize the code in this folder:
- Use the functions in `validator.js` to validate user inputs before processing.
- Implement the authentication logic provided in `auth.py` to manage user authentication within the project.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file contains input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username, allowing only alphanumeric characters and underscores within a specific length range.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character types, returning a descriptive level.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None
