# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This module handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side validation and auth.py for server-side authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It ensures that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submission.
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for server-side authentication. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes securely.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to suit the project requirements.
   - Include the `validator.js` file in the frontend code to enable client-side validation.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Implement additional authentication methods or customize existing ones.
   - Integrate the `auth.py` file with the backend system to handle user authentication processes effectively.
