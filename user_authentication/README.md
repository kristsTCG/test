# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes scripts for validating user input and handling user authentication using JavaScript and Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It currently contains two key files: `validator.js` for client-side input validation and `auth.py` for server-side authentication logic.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: Handles client-side input validation for user authentication forms.
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Language: JavaScript

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Manages server-side authentication processes such as user login and registration.
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Language: Python

## Usage
1. **validator.js**
   - Ensure the `validator.js` script is linked to your HTML files where user input validation is required.
   - Customize validation rules and error messages as needed.
   - Integrate the script with your form submission logic to prevent invalid data submission.

2. **auth.py**
   - Import the `auth.py` module in your server-side code where user authentication is needed.
   - Utilize the provided functions for user login, registration, and authentication.
   - Securely store sensitive information such as passwords and tokens as per best practices.

Remember to test the user authentication functionalities thoroughly to ensure a secure and seamless user experience.
