# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python. These files handle user input validation and authentication processes respectively.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file consists of 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.

2. `auth.py`: This Python file contains 2198 characters and is crucial for handling user authentication within the project. It manages the authentication logic, such as verifying user credentials and granting access to authorized users.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided by the `user_authentication` folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation criteria for user input.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to comprehend the authentication logic implemented in the project.
3. Integrate the validation and authentication processes into your project as needed, ensuring proper error handling and security measures are in place.
