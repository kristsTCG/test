# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles validation and authentication processes for user accounts.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.

2. `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication logic. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the system.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in the `user_authentication` folder:
1. Review the code in `validator.js` to understand the validation rules applied to user input data.
2. Explore the logic implemented in `auth.py` to manage user authentication processes.
3. Integrate these files into the project's authentication system as needed, ensuring proper validation and secure authentication mechanisms are in place.
