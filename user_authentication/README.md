# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes to ensure secure access to the system.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication features efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side validation written in JavaScript and auth.py for server-side authentication written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic to ensure that user input meets specified criteria before submitting to the server. It plays a crucial role in enhancing user experience by providing real-time feedback on input errors.
  
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is responsible for server-side authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication to grant access to authorized users. This file is essential for securing the system and protecting user data.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify validation rules as needed by updating the logic in `validator.js`.
   - Include `validator.js` in your HTML files using `<script>` tags to enable client-side validation.
   
2. **auth.py**:
   - Implement additional authentication features by extending the functionality in `auth.py`.
   - Integrate `auth.py` with your backend system to handle user authentication securely.
   - Ensure proper error handling and security measures are in place to prevent unauthorized access.

By following the guidelines above, you can effectively utilize the user authentication features provided in the `user_authentication` folder.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets complexity requirements.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username meets length and character requirements.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength level of a given password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class in your code:
```javascript
const InputValidator = require('./validator.js');
```
Then, you can use the validation methods like `InputValidator.validateEmail('example@email.com')`.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
