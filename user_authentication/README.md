# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with the authentication process.

2. **auth.py**: This Python file is 2198 characters long and manages the authentication logic for users. It handles user login, registration, and authentication processes using Python programming language.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules applied to user input data.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to understand the authentication logic implemented for user registration and login processes.
3. Modify the files as needed to customize the user authentication functionalities according to the project requirements.
