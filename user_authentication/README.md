# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains logic for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication tasks within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in the `user_authentication` folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the logic in `validator.js` to understand the validation rules applied to user input data.
2. Explore `auth.py` to understand how user authentication processes are managed in the project.
3. Integrate the validation and authentication functionalities into your project as needed, ensuring proper error handling and security measures are in place.
