# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for authentication processes.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
   
2. **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication logic using Python.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionalities, refer to the `validator.js` file and incorporate the validation functions into your user input handling processes.
   
2. For user authentication tasks such as login, registration, and authentication, utilize the functions and logic provided in the `auth.py` file. Ensure to integrate these functionalities into your project's authentication flow.

Ensure that you follow best practices for user authentication and input validation to enhance the security and reliability of your application.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username inputs, as well as determining the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets specific criteria (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username meets specific criteria (3-20 characters, alphanumeric and underscores only).
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Import the `UserAuth` class from this file to handle user authentication in your Python application.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
