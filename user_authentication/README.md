# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user inputs and ensuring data integrity during the authentication process.
- `auth.py`: This Python file contains 2198 characters and manages the authentication logic, including user login, registration, and session management.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionalities, refer to `validator.js`. Modify the validation rules as needed to suit the project requirements.
2. For authentication tasks such as user login and registration, interact with the functions defined in `auth.py`. Customize the authentication process based on the project's specifications.

Ensure that any changes made to these files align with the overall user authentication requirements of the project.
