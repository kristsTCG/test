# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This file contains JavaScript code (1212 characters) responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file (2198 characters) manages the authentication process for users. It handles user login, registration, and authentication using secure methods.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
- Use `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing it for authentication.
- Utilize `auth.py` for user authentication tasks such as login, registration, and authentication processes.

Ensure to follow the guidelines and methods defined in these files for secure and efficient user authentication within the project.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file contains input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username inputs, as well as determining the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates a password based on specific criteria (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates a username for length (3-20 characters) and allowed characters (alphanumeric and underscores only).
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types, returning a descriptive level.

**Usage:** This file can be imported into other JavaScript files using `require` or `import` statements to perform input validation for user authentication processes.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token for active sessions.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by removing the session token from active sessions.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication system. Call methods like `register_user`, `login`, `logout`, and `is_authenticated` as needed.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON operations.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
