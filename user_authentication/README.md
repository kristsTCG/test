# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions to validate user input for authentication purposes. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling the authentication logic. It manages user authentication processes such as login, logout, and session management.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules applied to user input.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to understand how user authentication is implemented in the project.
3. Modify the validation rules in `validator.js` as needed to customize user input validation.
4. Implement additional authentication features or modify existing ones in `auth.py` to meet project requirements.

Ensure that any changes made to the code in this folder are thoroughly tested to maintain the security and integrity of the user authentication system.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username inputs, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the provided validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** No notable dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class managing user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For working with JSON data.
- `datetime`: For handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
