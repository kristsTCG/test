# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input data related to authentication. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file is 2198 characters long and handles the authentication logic for users. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the application.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
- Use `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing it for authentication.
- Utilize `auth.py` for handling user authentication tasks such as login, registration, and authentication processes.
- Ensure that the functions and methods defined in these files are integrated correctly with other parts of the project that require user authentication.
