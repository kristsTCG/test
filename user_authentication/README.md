# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets specified criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication logic. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the system.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation criteria for user input data.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to understand the authentication processes implemented in Python.
3. Use the functions provided in these files to integrate user authentication features into the project.
4. Ensure to follow any guidelines or documentation within the files for proper usage and implementation.

- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the provided validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
