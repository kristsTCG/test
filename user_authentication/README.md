# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for authentication processes.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input data to ensure it meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
- **auth.py**: This file handles user authentication logic, such as verifying user credentials and generating authentication tokens.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Ensure Node.js is installed on your system.
   - Open `validator.js` in a code editor.
   - Modify the validation functions as needed to suit your project requirements.
   - Integrate the validation functions into your user authentication flow.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Make sure Python is installed on your system.
   - Open `auth.py` in a Python IDE or text editor.
   - Customize the authentication logic to match your application's requirements.
   - Utilize the authentication functions in your project for user login and access control.

Remember to handle sensitive user data securely and follow best practices for user authentication to enhance the security of your application.
