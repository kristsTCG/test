## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` contains two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters that handles validation of user input.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters that implements the authentication logic.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Role**: Responsible for validating user input.
- **Character Count**: 1212
- **Usage**: Ensures that user input meets specified criteria before proceeding with authentication.

### auth.py
- **Role**: Implements the authentication logic for user authentication.
- **Character Count**: 2198
- **Usage**: Manages the process of authenticating users based on provided credentials.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality, refer to `validator.js` and incorporate the validation logic into the user input handling process.
2. For user authentication, utilize the functions and logic defined in `auth.py` to authenticate users based on their credentials.
