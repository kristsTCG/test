# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input data related to authentication processes.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file is 2198 characters long and contains the authentication logic for verifying user credentials and managing user sessions.

## Usage
To utilize the code in this folder effectively, follow these steps:
1. Use `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing authentication requests.
2. Implement the authentication logic provided in `auth.py` to authenticate users and manage user sessions securely.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates that a password meets certain criteria (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username (3-20 characters, alphanumeric and underscores only).
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** This file can be imported into other JavaScript files using `require` or `import` statements, and the functions can be called as static methods of the `InputValidator` class.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token for active sessions.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by removing the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: Used for hashing passwords.
- `json`: Not used in the provided code but imported.
- `datetime`: Used for handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: Used for calculating expiration time for session tokens.
- `typing`: Used for type hints in function signatures.
