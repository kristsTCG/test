## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input to ensure data integrity and security.
- **auth.py**: This file handles user authentication processes such as login, registration, and password management.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Use the functions in this file to validate user input before processing it.
   - Import `validator.js` into your JavaScript files where input validation is required.
   - Customize the validation rules as per your project requirements.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Utilize the functions in this file for user authentication tasks.
   - Import `auth.py` into your Python scripts to implement authentication features.
   - Follow the documentation within the file for specific usage instructions for each function.
