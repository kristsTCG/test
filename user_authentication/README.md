# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes a JavaScript file for validation logic and a Python file for handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication features efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side validation and auth.py for server-side authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation logic for user inputs. It plays a crucial role in ensuring data integrity and security.
- **auth.py**: The Python file auth.py is responsible for handling server-side authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed for user input fields.
   - Include this file in your HTML pages to enable client-side validation.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Configure the authentication settings such as database connections and encryption methods.
   - Integrate the authentication logic into your backend services for user authentication.

Ensure to maintain the integrity and security of user authentication processes by following best practices and regularly updating the validation and authentication logic in these files.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is 3-20 characters long and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of the input password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class where input validation is needed and call the respective validation functions or password strength function.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
