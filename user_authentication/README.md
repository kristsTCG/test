# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes a JavaScript file for validation (`validator.js`) and a Python file for authentication (`auth.py`).

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input, ensuring data integrity and security.
- `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes, such as login, registration, and session management.

## Usage
Developers can utilize the `validator.js` file to validate user input before processing it further. The `auth.py` file provides authentication functionalities that can be integrated into the project for user login and registration processes. Ensure to follow the documentation within each file for proper implementation and usage.
