## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: Responsible for validating user input data.
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Language: JavaScript

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Handles authentication logic for user login and access control.
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Language: Python

## Usage
1. **validator.js**
   - Ensure the `validator.js` file is included in the appropriate modules where user input validation is required.
   - Use the functions provided in `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing.

2. **auth.py**
   - Import `auth.py` in modules requiring user authentication functionalities.
   - Utilize the functions defined in `auth.py` for user login, authentication, and access control mechanisms.

Remember to maintain the integrity of user authentication processes and handle sensitive user data securely within the codebase.
