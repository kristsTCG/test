## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes the following key components:
- `validator.js`: JavaScript file for validating user input. (1212 characters)
- `auth.py`: Python file for handling user authentication. (2198 characters)

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file is responsible for validating user input to ensure data integrity and security.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file manages user authentication processes, such as login, logout, and session management.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionality in this folder:
1. Modify the `validator.js` file to customize input validation rules.
