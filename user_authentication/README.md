# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It ensures that user-provided data meets specified criteria before submission.
- **auth.py**: This file contains server-side authentication logic for verifying user credentials and managing user sessions.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review `validator.js` for client-side validation rules and customize them as needed.
2. Examine `auth.py` to understand the server-side authentication process and make any necessary adjustments.
3. Ensure that both files are integrated correctly within the project to provide a seamless user authentication experience.

- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
