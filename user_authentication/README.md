# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the data provided by users meet the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file consists of 2198 characters and manages the authentication process for users. It handles user login, registration, and authentication logic.

## Usage
1. To utilize the functionalities provided by the `validator.js` file, import it into your JavaScript code using `import validator from './validator.js'`. Then, call the necessary validation functions as needed in your user authentication workflows.

2. For the `auth.py` file, import it into your Python code using `import auth`. You can then use the functions defined in this file to handle user authentication tasks such as login, registration, and authentication processes.
