# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for client-side validation and `auth.py` written in Python for server-side authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input on the client-side. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submission.
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling server-side authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication logic within the application.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Utilize `validator.js` functions to validate user input on the client-side before submitting forms.
2. Implement the authentication logic defined in `auth.py` to manage user login and registration processes on the server-side.
3. Ensure that both client-side and server-side validations are in sync to provide a secure and seamless user authentication experience.
