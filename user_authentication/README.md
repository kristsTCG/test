# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side validation written in JavaScript and auth.py for server-side authentication written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submission.
  
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is responsible for server-side authentication processes. It handles user authentication, login, and logout functionalities using Python.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to suit the project's requirements.
   - Include the `validator.js` file in your HTML pages using the `<script>` tag.
   - Call the validation functions on user input fields to validate user data before submission.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Implement additional authentication logic as required by the project.
   - Ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed to run the Python script successfully.
   - Integrate the authentication functionalities provided by `auth.py` into your project's backend system.

By following the guidelines above, you can effectively utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in the `user_authentication` folder.
