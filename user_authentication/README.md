# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized with two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python. These files handle different aspects of user authentication within the project.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that the data provided by users meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python file is responsible for handling the authentication process. It includes functions for user login, registration, and authentication checks. 

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality, refer to `validator.js`. This file contains functions that can be imported and used in other parts of the project to validate user input data.

2. For authentication processes such as user login and registration, refer to `auth.py`. This file provides the necessary functions to authenticate users and manage their access to the system.

3. Ensure to follow the documentation within each file for specific usage instructions and parameters required for the functions provided.

- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates a username for length and character constraints.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on various criteria.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class where input validation is needed and call the desired validation method.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** User authentication system with login and registration functionality.
