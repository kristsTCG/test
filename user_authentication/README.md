## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This functionality is crucial for managing user access and security.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side validation in JavaScript and auth.py for server-side authentication in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic for user inputs. It helps ensure that user-provided data meets specified criteria before submission.
- **auth.py**: The auth.py file is responsible for server-side authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication using Python.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**: To use the client-side validation logic provided in validator.js, include this file in your HTML file using a script tag. You can then call the validation functions defined within this file to validate user inputs before form submission.

2. **auth.py**: Incorporate the authentication functionalities provided in auth.py by importing this file into your Python project. Utilize the functions defined within auth.py to handle user login, registration, and authentication processes securely. Ensure to configure the necessary database connections and encryption mechanisms as per project requirements.
