# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This functionality is crucial for managing user access and security.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication logic using different programming languages. Currently, it includes a JavaScript file (`validator.js`) and a Python file (`auth.py`).

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data related to authentication. It plays a key role in ensuring the integrity of user-provided information.
- `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes within the project. It likely includes functions for user login, registration, and authentication checks.

## Usage
Developers can utilize the `validator.js` file to validate user input data for authentication purposes in JavaScript-based components of the project. Similarly, the `auth.py` file can be used to implement user authentication logic in Python-based components. Ensure to follow the functions and methods defined in these files for seamless integration of user authentication features.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file contains input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character requirements.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the provided validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token for active sessions.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session by removing the session token from active sessions.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
