## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: Responsible for validating user input data.
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Language: JavaScript

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Manages user authentication processes.
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Language: Python

## Usage
1. **validator.js**
   - To use the `validator.js` file, import it into your JavaScript code using `import validator from './validator.js';`.
   - Utilize the validation functions provided in the file to validate user input data before processing.

2. **auth.py**
   - To work with `auth.py`, import it into your Python code using `import auth`.
   - Use the functions within `auth.py` to handle user authentication tasks such as login, registration, and password management.
