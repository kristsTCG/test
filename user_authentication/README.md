# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It includes functions for user login, registration, and authentication.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the code in `validator.js` to understand the validation rules applied to user input data.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to understand how user authentication processes are implemented.
3. Integrate these files into your project to enable user authentication features.
4. Ensure to customize the authentication logic as per your project requirements.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username, allowing alphanumeric characters and underscores within a specific length range.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Assesses the strength of a password based on length and character types, returning a descriptive strength level.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to access the validation and strength assessment methods.

**Dependencies:** None

## auth.py

**Purpose:** User authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class managing user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to use its methods for user registration, login, logout, and session validation.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: for hashing functions.
- `json`: for JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: for date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: for time duration calculations.
- `typing`: for type hints.
