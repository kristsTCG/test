# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that the data entered by users meets the required criteria.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python file is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication logic within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules applied to user input.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to comprehend the user authentication processes implemented in the project.
3. Make necessary modifications or enhancements to suit the specific requirements of the project related to user authentication.
