# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for authentication logic.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
  
- `auth.py`: This Python file is responsible for handling user authentication within the project. It contains functions and logic for verifying user credentials and managing user sessions securely.

## Usage
1. To utilize the input validation functionality, refer to `validator.js` and incorporate the validation functions into your code where necessary.
2. For user authentication tasks, utilize the functions and logic provided in `auth.py` to authenticate users securely and manage user sessions effectively.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric and underscores only.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on various criteria.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that handles user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes the password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates the user and generates a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends the user session based on the session token.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if the session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: Used for hashing passwords.
- `json`: Used for JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: Used for handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: Used for calculating time differences.
- `typing`: Used for type hints.
