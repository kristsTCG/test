# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It includes files responsible for validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: Responsible for validating user input data.
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Language: JavaScript

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Manages user authentication processes.
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Language: Python

## Usage
1. **validator.js**
   - Ensure the necessary JavaScript environment is set up.
   - Modify the validation rules as needed in the file.
   - Import and use the validation functions in other parts of the project where user input needs validation.

2. **auth.py**
   - Set up a Python environment with the required dependencies.
   - Customize the authentication logic to fit the project's requirements.
   - Integrate the authentication functions into the project to handle user login, registration, and authentication processes.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length and character requirements.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username allowing alphanumeric characters and underscores within a specific length range.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Assesses the strength of a password based on length and character complexity.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class and call the validation functions as needed.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token if successful.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the provided session token.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Import the `UserAuth` class from this file to handle user authentication operations in your Python application.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization/deserialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta` from `datetime`: For calculating expiration time for session tokens.
- `typing.Optional` and `typing.Dict`: For type hinting.
