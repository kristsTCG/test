# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` consists of two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters that handles user input validation.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters responsible for user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Role**: Handles user input validation.
- **Character Count**: 1212
- **Usage**: Ensures that user input meets specified criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.

### auth.py
- **Role**: Manages user authentication processes.
- **Character Count**: 2198
- **Usage**: Handles user login, registration, and authentication within the system.

## Usage
1. To utilize the user input validation functionality:
   - Open and modify the `validator.js` file as needed.
   - Ensure that the validation criteria align with the project requirements.
   - Integrate the validation functions into the appropriate parts of the project where user input validation is required.

2. To implement user authentication processes:
   - Access and customize the `auth.py` file to suit the project's authentication needs.
   - Utilize the functions within `auth.py` for user registration, login, and authentication.
   - Integrate the authentication logic into the project's user management system for secure user interactions.
