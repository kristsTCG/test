# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This file contains JavaScript code for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file handles the authentication logic for users. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the project.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionalities, refer to `validator.js` and integrate the validation logic into your user input forms or data processing scripts.
   
2. For user authentication tasks, utilize `auth.py` to handle user login, registration, and authentication processes. Ensure to follow the defined authentication flow within the file for seamless user authentication within the project.
