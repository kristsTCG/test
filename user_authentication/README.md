- **auth.py**: This Python file handles server-side authentication processes. It verifies user credentials, generates tokens, and manages user sessions.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Include the validator.js file in your HTML file using `<script src="path/to/validator.js"></script>`.
   - Use the provided validation functions to validate user inputs before form submission.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Import the auth module in your Python project using `import auth`.
   - Utilize the authentication functions such as `verify_user_credentials(username, password)` to authenticate users.
   - Generate tokens using `generate_token(user_id)` for secure user sessions.
