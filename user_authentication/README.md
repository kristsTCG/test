# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the data entered by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.

2. `auth.py`: This Python file, 2198 characters long, handles the authentication logic for users. It verifies user credentials and manages the authentication flow within the system.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
- Review `validator.js` to understand the validation rules applied to user input.
- Examine `auth.py` to understand the authentication logic and processes implemented in the system.
- Make necessary modifications or enhancements to the code based on project requirements.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file contains input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates that a password meets certain criteria (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates that a username is 3-20 characters long and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the provided validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password()`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user()`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login()`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout()`: Method to end a user's session.
- `is_authenticated()`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: Used for hashing passwords.
- `json`: Not used in this file but imported.
- `datetime`: Used for handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: Used for calculating session expiration time.
- `typing`: Used for type hints.
