# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` for client-side input validation written in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication logic written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic to ensure that user input meets specified criteria before submitting it to the server for authentication.
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file houses the server-side authentication logic responsible for verifying user credentials and granting access to authenticated users.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - To use the validation logic in `validator.js`, include the file in your HTML file using a script tag.
   - Call the validation functions provided in `validator.js` on user input fields to ensure data integrity before submission.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Import `auth.py` into your server-side codebase to leverage the authentication functionalities.
   - Utilize the functions defined in `auth.py` to authenticate users based on their credentials and manage access control within your application.

Ensure that both client-side and server-side authentication processes are synchronized to provide a secure and seamless user experience.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength and format of a password.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Assesses the strength of a password based on length and character requirements.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication process.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to use the authentication system. Call methods like `register_user`, `login`, `logout`, and `is_authenticated` as needed.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib` for hashing functions.
- `json` for JSON serialization.
- `datetime` for working with dates and times.
- `timedelta` for calculating time differences.
- `typing` for type hints.
