# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes a JavaScript file for validation logic and a Python file for handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` for client-side validation and `auth.py` for server-side authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file (1212 characters) is responsible for client-side validation of user input. It ensures that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submission.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python file (2198 characters) manages server-side authentication processes. It handles user login, registration, and authentication logic to ensure secure access to the application.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to match the project's requirements.
   - Include this file in the frontend codebase to validate user input before submitting forms.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Implement additional authentication features such as two-factor authentication or password reset functionalities.
   - Integrate this file with the backend services to manage user authentication securely.

Ensure to maintain the integrity of the authentication process and follow best practices for user data protection.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file contains input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on various criteria.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** No notable dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user authentication operations.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token for active sessions.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by invalidating the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to perform user registration, login, logout, and session validation operations.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints (not used in this file).
