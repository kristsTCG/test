# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes the following key components:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file containing functions for validating user input.
- `auth.py`: A Python file responsible for handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Role**: Contains functions for validating user input data.
- **Size**: 1212 characters
- **Usage**: Used to ensure that user-provided data meets specified criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.

### auth.py
- **Role**: Manages user authentication processes such as login, registration, and verification.
- **Size**: 2198 characters
- **Usage**: Handles user authentication tasks and interacts with the database to authenticate users securely.

## Usage
1. Utilize `validator.js` functions to validate user input data before processing authentication.
2. Implement `auth.py` methods to manage user authentication processes like login, registration, and verification.
3. Ensure proper integration with other project components that require user authentication functionalities.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the format of a password (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username (3-20 characters, alphanumeric and underscores only).
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use its validation methods in user authentication processes.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token for active sessions.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the provided session token.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid and the user is authenticated.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: Used for hashing passwords.
- `json`: Used for JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: Used for handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: Used for calculating time differences.
- `typing`: Used for type hints.
