# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python file manages the authentication process for users. It handles tasks such as verifying user credentials, generating tokens, and authorizing access to protected resources.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
1. Review the code in `validator.js` to understand the validation rules applied to user data.
2. Explore `auth.py` to comprehend the authentication flow and implement necessary changes or integrations.
3. Ensure that both files are appropriately integrated into the project to enable secure user authentication processes.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric characters and underscores within a specific length range.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the provided validation methods in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token for active sessions.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session by removing the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in the provided code snippet).
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
