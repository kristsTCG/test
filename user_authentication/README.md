# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` consists of two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters that handles input validation for user authentication.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters responsible for user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Role**: Handles input validation for user authentication.
- **Size**: 1212 characters
- **Usage**: Ensures that user input meets specified criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.

### auth.py
- **Role**: Manages user authentication processes.
- **Size**: 2198 characters
- **Usage**: Implements authentication logic such as verifying user credentials and granting access.

## Usage
1. To utilize the input validation functionality, refer to `validator.js`. Modify the validation criteria as needed to suit the project requirements.
2. For user authentication processes, interact with `auth.py`. Implement any additional authentication logic required for the project.

Ensure that any modifications made to these files align with the overall user authentication requirements of the project.
