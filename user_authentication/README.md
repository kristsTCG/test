# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` contains two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters, responsible for validating user input.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters, handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file is crucial for ensuring that user input meets specified criteria and is safe for processing within the application. It contains functions for validating various types of user data.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is essential for managing user authentication within the project. It handles processes such as user login, registration, and authentication checks.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the necessary functions into your JavaScript files and call them as needed to validate user input.
2. For user authentication processes, interact with the functions defined in `auth.py`. This includes functions for user login, registration, and authentication checks.

Ensure that you understand the specific requirements and functionalities of each file before integrating them into your project.
