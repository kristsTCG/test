# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. It includes a JavaScript file for validation and a Python file for handling authentication.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks, including validation and authentication processes. The key components include a validator script in JavaScript and an authentication script in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file (1212 characters) is responsible for validating user input for authentication purposes. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python file (2198 characters) manages the authentication process for users. It handles user login, registration, and authentication tasks within the system.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionality in this folder:
1. Use the `validator.js` file to validate user input data before processing it.
2. Implement the functions provided in `auth.py` to handle user authentication tasks such as login, registration, and authentication.
3. Ensure that the authentication logic in `auth.py` aligns with the project's requirements and security standards.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric and underscore characters.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on various criteria.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Method to register a new user.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Method to authenticate a user and return a session token.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Method to end a user session.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Method to check if a session is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
