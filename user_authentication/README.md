# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` and `auth.py`, which are crucial for validating user input and managing user authentication in JavaScript and Python, respectively.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.

2. **auth.py**: This Python file is 2198 characters long and handles user authentication tasks. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionality in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Use the `validator.js` file to validate user input before processing authentication requests.
2. Utilize the `auth.py` file to manage user authentication tasks such as login, registration, and authentication processes.

Ensure that the code in these files is integrated correctly with the rest of the project to maintain secure user authentication processes.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password and returns a descriptive level.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies required for this file.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** User authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the session token.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to utilize user authentication functionalities.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
