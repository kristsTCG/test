# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This functionality is crucial for managing user access and security.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks. It includes validator.js for client-side validation logic in JavaScript and auth.py for server-side authentication logic in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic written in JavaScript. It plays a key role in ensuring that user input is validated before submission.
- **auth.py**: The auth.py file contains server-side authentication logic written in Python. It handles user authentication processes, such as login, registration, and password management.

## Usage
1. To utilize the client-side validation logic, refer to the `validator.js` file and integrate it into your frontend code where user input validation is required.
2. For server-side authentication processes, utilize the `auth.py` file by importing its functions and integrating them into your backend codebase to manage user authentication tasks effectively.
