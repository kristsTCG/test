# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It includes validation logic in JavaScript and authentication logic in Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks. It contains two key files: `validator.js` for input validation and `auth.py` for user authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains logic for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication tasks within the application.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Use `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing authentication requests.
2. Utilize `auth.py` for implementing user authentication functionalities such as login, registration, and authentication processes.
3. Ensure that the logic in both files aligns with the project's user authentication requirements.
