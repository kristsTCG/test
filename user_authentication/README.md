# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This module is responsible for validating user input and handling user authentication processes.

## Structure
The `user_authentication` folder is organized as follows:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file containing functions for validating user input.
- `auth.py`: A Python file that implements user authentication logic.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Role**: Responsible for validating user input.
- **Size**: 1212 characters
- **Usage**: Used to ensure the correctness of user-provided data before processing.

### auth.py
- **Role**: Implements user authentication logic.
- **Size**: 2198 characters
- **Usage**: Handles user authentication processes such as login, registration, and password management.

## Usage
1. Utilize `validator.js` to validate user input by calling the appropriate validation functions.
2. Incorporate `auth.py` to implement user authentication features in the project.
3. Ensure to understand the functions and logic within each file to effectively handle user authentication processes.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric and underscore characters.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the session token.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to access the user authentication functionalities.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
