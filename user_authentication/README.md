# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user inputs and ensuring data integrity during the authentication process.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python file contains 2198 characters and manages the authentication logic, including user login, registration, and session management.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review `validator.js` for input validation logic and make necessary adjustments to fit the project requirements.
2. Examine `auth.py` to understand the authentication flow and customize it as needed for user registration and login functionalities.
3. Ensure that both files are integrated correctly with other components of the project that require user authentication.
