# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder contains two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters, responsible for validating user input.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters, handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file is crucial for ensuring that user input meets the required criteria. It contains functions for validating user data before it is processed further in the system.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is essential for handling user authentication within the project. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes to ensure secure access to the system.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review `validator.js` to understand the validation logic and criteria for user input.
2. Explore `auth.py` to familiarize yourself with the user authentication processes implemented in the project.
3. Integrate these files into your project to enable user authentication functionality.
4. Ensure proper error handling and security measures are in place when utilizing these components.
