# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` for client-side input validation written in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication logic written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic to ensure that user input meets specified criteria before submitting it to the server. It plays a crucial role in maintaining data integrity and security.
  
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is responsible for server-side authentication processes. It manages user authentication, login sessions, and authorization within the application. This file is essential for securing user accounts and controlling access to protected resources.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to match the project's requirements.
   - Include the `validator.js` file in your HTML templates using a `<script>` tag.
   - Call the validation functions from your form submission logic to validate user input before sending it to the server.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Implement additional authentication methods or customize the existing ones to suit your project's needs.
   - Ensure that the `auth.py` file is properly integrated with your application's backend logic.
   - Use the provided functions to authenticate users, manage sessions, and enforce access control policies.

By following the guidelines above, you can effectively leverage the user authentication features provided in this folder for your project.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is between 3-20 characters long and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on its length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token for active sessions.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session by removing the session token from active sessions.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and not expired.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For handling JSON data.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
