- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters responsible for validating user input data.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters that handle user authentication logic.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file is crucial for validating user input data to ensure it meets the required criteria. It plays a significant role in maintaining data integrity and security.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is essential for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication functionalities within the project.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review `validator.js` to understand the validation rules applied to user input data.
