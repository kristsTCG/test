# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for authentication logic.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
   
2. `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling authentication logic. It manages user authentication processes such as login, registration, and password management within the application.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
- Use `validator.js` functions to validate user input before processing authentication requests.
- Utilize `auth.py` for implementing user authentication functionalities in the project.
- Ensure to understand the logic and flow between these files to maintain a secure and efficient user authentication system.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates an email address based on a regular expression pattern.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates a password based on specific criteria (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates a username based on length and allowed characters.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and hashed password.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the provided session token.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid and the user is authenticated.

**Usage:** Import the `UserAuth` class from this file to handle user authentication in your Python application.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
