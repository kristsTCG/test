# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling the authentication process. It includes functions for user login, registration, and authentication logic.

## Usage
To utilize the functionality provided in this folder, developers can integrate the validation functions from `validator.js` into their frontend forms to ensure data integrity. The authentication logic in `auth.py` can be used to manage user authentication processes on the backend. Ensure to follow the specific usage instructions provided within each file for seamless integration.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength and format of a password.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** This file can be imported as a module to perform input validation tasks in user authentication processes.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes the password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates the user with username and password, returning a session token if successful.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends the user session based on the provided session token.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if the session token is valid and the user is authenticated.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations like registration, login, logout, and session validation.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: Used for hashing passwords.
- `json`: Not used in this file but imported.
- `datetime`: Used for handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: Used for calculating expiration time for user sessions.
- `typing`: Used for type hints.
