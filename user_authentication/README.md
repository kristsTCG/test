# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes validation logic in JavaScript and authentication logic in Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication processes. It contains two key files, `validator.js` for input validation and `auth.py` for user authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains logic for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria.
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` handles user authentication processes. It is responsible for verifying user credentials and granting access to authorized users.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to suit the project requirements.
   - Include `validator.js` in the appropriate modules where user input validation is required.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Implement additional authentication logic as per project specifications.
   - Integrate `auth.py` with other parts of the project that require user authentication.

Ensure that both files are utilized correctly to maintain secure and efficient user authentication processes in the project.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file contains input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character requirements.

**Usage:** This file can be imported as a module in other JavaScript files to perform input validation for user authentication.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Method to register a new user.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Method to authenticate a user and return a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Method to end a user session.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Method to check if a session is valid.

**Usage:** Import the `UserAuth` class from this file to handle user authentication in your Python application.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
