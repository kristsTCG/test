# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains code for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user data meets the required criteria before authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling the authentication process. It manages user login, registration, and authentication logic within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionality provided in this folder, you can refer to the respective files for implementing validation and authentication processes in your project. Make sure to integrate these files into your application as needed to secure user interactions.
