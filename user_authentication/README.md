# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This functionality is crucial for managing user access and security.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side validation in JavaScript and auth.py for server-side authentication in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic for user input, ensuring that data entered by users meets specified criteria before submission.
- **auth.py**: This file handles server-side authentication processes, such as verifying user credentials, generating tokens, and managing user sessions.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**: To utilize the client-side validation provided by `validator.js`, include this file in your HTML pages using a `<script>` tag. Then, call the appropriate validation functions on user input fields to enforce validation rules.
   
   Example:
   ```html
   <script src="path/to/validator.js"></script>
   <script>
       // Call validation functions on user input fields
       validateUsername();
       validatePassword();
   </script>
   ```

2. **auth.py**: To leverage the server-side authentication functionalities in `auth.py`, import this file into your Python project. Use the provided functions to authenticate users, manage sessions, and secure access to protected resources.
   
   Example:
   ```python
   from auth import authenticate_user, generate_token

   # Authenticate a user
   user = authenticate_user(username, password)

   # Generate a token for the authenticated user
   token = generate_token(user)
   ```

Ensure proper integration of these files into your project to enhance user authentication capabilities effectively.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Assesses the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** This file can be imported as a module in other JavaScript files to perform input validation for user authentication.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies and can be used independently for input validation tasks.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session by invalidating the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and not expired.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations like registration, login, and session handling.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints (not used in this file).
