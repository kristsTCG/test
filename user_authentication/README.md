# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes a JavaScript file for validation logic and a Python file for authentication processes.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python file contains 2198 characters and handles the authentication logic for users. It verifies user credentials and manages the authentication flow within the system.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality, refer to the `validator.js` file and integrate the validation logic into the user input forms.
   
2. For user authentication processes, utilize the `auth.py` file to authenticate users based on their credentials and manage the authentication flow within the project.
