# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication logic within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionality provided in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules and functions available for user input.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to understand the authentication logic and methods implemented for user registration and login.
3. Integrate these files into your project as needed to enhance user authentication capabilities.
