# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It includes validation logic in JavaScript and authentication logic in Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks. It contains two key files: `validator.js` for input validation and `auth.py` for user authentication.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters of code responsible for validating user inputs. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.

2. `auth.py`: This Python file consists of 2198 characters of code dedicated to user authentication. It manages the authentication process, including verifying user credentials and granting access to authorized users.

## Usage
To utilize the code in this folder:
- Modify the validation rules in `validator.js` to suit the project's requirements.
- Implement the authentication logic in `auth.py` to authenticate users securely.
- Ensure proper integration of these files with other components of the project for seamless user authentication.

**Usage:** This file can be imported as a module to perform input validation for user authentication in a JavaScript application.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
