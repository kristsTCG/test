# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It includes a JavaScript file for validation logic and a Python file for handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It houses validator.js for client-side input validation and auth.py for server-side authentication operations.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user inputs on the client side. It ensures that data entered by users meets specified criteria before submission.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python file, with 2198 characters, handles user authentication on the server side. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes, ensuring secure access to the system.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation logic, refer to `validator.js` and integrate the validation functions into your front-end forms to enhance user input validation.
   
2. For server-side authentication functionalities, consult `auth.py` to understand how user authentication is handled within the project. Implement necessary endpoints and functions to manage user login and registration securely.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric and underscore characters.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by invalidating the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** To use this file, create an instance of `UserAuth` and call its methods for user registration, login, logout, and session validation.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib` for hashing functions.
- `json` for JSON serialization/deserialization.
- `datetime` for handling date and time operations.
- `typing` for type hints.
