## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: Handles client-side input validation.
   - Size: 1212 characters.
   
2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Manages server-side authentication processes.
   - Size: 2198 characters.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**
   - Ensure the file is linked in your HTML file for client-side validation.
   - Modify validation rules as needed for your project requirements.
   
2. **auth.py**
   - Integrate the authentication logic into your server-side code.
   - Customize authentication methods and error handling based on your project's needs.
