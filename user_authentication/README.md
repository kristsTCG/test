# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side validation and auth.py for server-side authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation logic for user inputs. It ensures that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submission.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for server-side authentication. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes securely on the server side.

## Usage
1. To use the client-side validation provided by `validator.js`, include the script in your HTML file using `<script src="path/to/validator.js"></script>`. Then, call the validation functions as needed in your front-end code.

2. For server-side authentication using `auth.py`, ensure that the file is imported or included in your server-side codebase. Utilize the functions provided within `auth.py` to handle user authentication tasks securely.

3. Make sure to customize the authentication logic based on your project requirements and integrate it with your existing user management system for a seamless user authentication experience.
