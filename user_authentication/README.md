# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` and `auth.py`, which are responsible for validating user input and handling authentication processes, respectively.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that the data entered by users meets the required criteria.
- `auth.py`: This Python file handles the authentication logic for users. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the application.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review `validator.js` to understand the validation rules applied to user input.
2. Explore `auth.py` to understand how user authentication processes are implemented.
3. Use the functions provided in these files to integrate user authentication features into the project.
4. Ensure that proper error handling is in place to manage authentication failures and input validation errors effectively.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is between 3-20 characters, alphanumeric, and underscores only.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of the input password based on its length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication process.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: For date and time operations.
- `timedelta` from `datetime`: For time duration calculations.
- `typing.Optional` and `typing.Dict`: For type hints.
