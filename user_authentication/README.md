# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains code for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling the authentication process. It manages user login, registration, and authentication tasks within the system.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionality provided in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the code in `validator.js` to understand the validation rules applied to user input.
2. Explore `auth.py` to understand how user authentication processes are implemented.
3. Integrate the validation and authentication logic into your project as needed.
4. Test the functionality thoroughly to ensure it meets the security and usability requirements of your application.
