## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: Responsible for validating user input data.
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Language: JavaScript

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Manages user authentication processes.
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Language: Python

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality, refer to `validator.js`. This file contains functions to validate user input data such as email addresses, passwords, etc.
   
2. For user authentication processes, refer to `auth.py`. This file handles tasks such as user login, registration, and authentication.

3. Ensure to integrate these files into the project's authentication flow to enhance security and user experience.
