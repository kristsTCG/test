# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This module handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication features efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side validation and auth.py for server-side authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It ensures that user-provided data meets specified criteria before submission.
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for server-side authentication. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**: To use the client-side validation logic, include `validator.js` in your HTML file using a script tag. You can call the validation functions defined in this file to validate user input before form submission.
   
2. **auth.py**: To utilize the server-side authentication functionalities, import `auth.py` in your Python project. You can then use the functions provided in this file to handle user authentication tasks such as login, registration, and authentication checks.
