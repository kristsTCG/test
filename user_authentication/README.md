# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes a JavaScript file for validation and a Python file for authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains code for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria.
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication within the system.

## Usage
Developers can utilize the `validator.js` file to implement input validation for user data. They can customize the validation rules based on project requirements.

The `auth.py` file provides the necessary functions for user authentication. Developers can integrate these functions into the project to manage user login and registration processes securely.
