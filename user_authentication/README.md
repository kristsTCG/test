# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This module is responsible for validating user inputs and handling user authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user inputs. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.

2. `auth.py`: This Python file is 2198 characters long and handles the authentication logic for users. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the system.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules applied to user inputs.
2. Examine the `auth.py` file to understand the authentication logic and processes implemented for user authentication.
3. Modify or extend the code in these files as needed to customize user authentication functionalities for your project.
