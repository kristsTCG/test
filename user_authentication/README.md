# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication features efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side validation and auth.py for server-side authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation logic for user inputs. It plays a crucial role in ensuring data integrity before sending it to the server.
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for server-side authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication against the database.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Modify `validator.js` to customize client-side validation rules as needed.
2. Update `auth.py` to enhance server-side authentication functionalities, such as adding additional security checks or integrating with external authentication services.

Ensure that any changes made adhere to the project's authentication requirements and security standards.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates a password based on specific criteria (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates a username for length and allowed characters (3-20 characters, alphanumeric and underscores only).
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character requirements.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to utilize user authentication functionalities.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
