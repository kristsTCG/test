# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate the validation logic implemented in JavaScript from the authentication logic implemented in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains the user validation logic, comprising 1212 characters. It is responsible for validating user input and ensuring data integrity.
   
2. **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is written in Python and contains the authentication logic for user authentication. It consists of 2198 characters and handles user login, registration, and authentication processes.

## Usage
1. To work with the user validation logic, refer to `validator.js`. This file contains functions and methods for validating user input data before proceeding with authentication processes.

2. For user authentication functionalities, refer to `auth.py`. This Python file provides the necessary functions for user login, registration, and authentication within the project. Make sure to understand the functions and methods defined in this file to integrate user authentication seamlessly.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file contains input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username inputs, as well as determining the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric and underscore characters.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** This file can be imported as a module to perform input validation tasks in user authentication processes.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies are required for this file.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to use the provided authentication functionalities.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
