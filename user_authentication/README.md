# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It handles the validation and authentication of user credentials.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate the validation logic in `validator.js` written in JavaScript and the authentication logic in `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This file contains the validation logic for user credentials. It ensures that the input data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
- `auth.py`: This file handles the authentication process for users. It verifies the user's credentials and grants access based on the authentication result.

## Usage
1. To use the validation functionality, refer to `validator.js` and incorporate the validation logic into your user authentication flow.
2. For user authentication, utilize `auth.py` to authenticate users based on their credentials. Make necessary calls to this file to authenticate users securely.
