# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes the following key components:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file containing functions for validating user input data.
- `auth.py`: A Python file responsible for handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- Role: Responsible for validating user input data to ensure data integrity and security.
- Size: 1212 characters
- Language: JavaScript

### auth.py
- Role: Manages user authentication processes such as login, registration, and authentication checks.
- Size: 2198 characters
- Language: Python

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in the `user_authentication` folder:
1. Use the functions defined in `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing.
2. Implement the logic in `auth.py` to handle user authentication tasks such as user login, registration, and authentication checks.
3. Ensure to integrate these files with other parts of the project where user authentication is required.

- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is 3-20 characters long and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of the input password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the provided validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py
