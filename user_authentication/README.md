# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for authentication logic.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: Responsible for validating user input data.
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Language: JavaScript

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Manages user authentication processes.
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Language: Python

## Usage
1. **validator.js**
   - To use the validation functions provided in `validator.js`, import the module into your JavaScript file using `require` or `import`.
   - Call the appropriate validation functions with the user input data to validate it according to the defined rules.

2. **auth.py**
   - Import the `auth` module into your Python script to access the authentication functionalities.
   - Utilize the provided functions for user authentication, such as login, logout, and token generation.

Ensure that you understand the specific requirements and guidelines for user authentication in your project before integrating these files.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character requirements.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For time duration calculations.
- `typing`: For type hints.
