# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This functionality is crucial for managing user access and security.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication logic using different programming languages. Currently, it includes a JavaScript file (`validator.js`) and a Python file (`auth.py`).

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains logic for validating user input related to authentication, such as email addresses and passwords.
- `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` handles authentication processes, including user login, registration, and token generation.

## Usage
1. To work with the validation logic, refer to `validator.js` and integrate the validation functions into your user authentication forms.
2. For server-side authentication processes, utilize the functions defined in `auth.py` to handle user registration, login, and token generation.
3. Ensure that the authentication logic is integrated securely within your project to safeguard user data and access.
