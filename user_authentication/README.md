# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It ensures that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submission.
- **auth.py**: This file contains server-side authentication logic written in Python. It handles user authentication processes such as login, registration, and session management.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to suit the project's requirements.
   - Include the script in your HTML files to enable client-side validation.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Configure the authentication settings such as database connections and encryption methods.
   - Integrate the authentication logic into your project's backend to secure user authentication processes.

Ensure that both files work together seamlessly to provide a secure and user-friendly authentication experience for your project.
