# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
- `auth.py`: This Python file handles the authentication logic for users. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the system.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions, refer to `validator.js` and integrate the necessary validation checks in your user input forms.
2. For user authentication functionalities, refer to `auth.py` and incorporate the authentication logic into your application's backend system.

Ensure that you understand the functions and methods defined in these files to effectively implement user authentication features in your project.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class and call the desired validation methods.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** User authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class managing user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the session token.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to utilize user authentication functionalities like registration, login, logout, and session validation.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing.Optional`: For specifying optional return types.
- `typing.Dict`: For specifying dictionary types.
