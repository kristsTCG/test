# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
- `auth.py`: This Python file handles the authentication process for users. It includes functions for user login, registration, and other authentication-related tasks.

## Usage
To utilize the code in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation logic implemented for user input data.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to understand how user authentication is handled within the project.
3. Modify or extend the existing code as needed to fit the specific requirements of the project.
4. Ensure that any changes made adhere to the project's authentication guidelines and security best practices.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates an email address based on a regular expression pattern.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates a password based on specific criteria (length, uppercase, lowercase, and number requirements).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates a username based on length and character restrictions.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the provided validation functions in your authentication process.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** User authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class managing user authentication operations.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Register a new user with username, email, and password.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticate user and return session token.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: End user session.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Check if session token is valid.

**Usage:** Import `auth.py` and create an instance of `UserAuth` to use the authentication functionalities.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON operations.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
