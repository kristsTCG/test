# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input data for authentication purposes. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file consists of 2198 characters and handles the authentication logic for users. It verifies user credentials and manages the authentication process within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionalities in the project, you can refer to the following steps:
1. Modify the `validator.js` file to customize the validation rules according to project requirements.
2. Implement the authentication logic using the functions provided in the `auth.py` file.
3. Ensure to integrate these files with other components of the project that require user authentication.
4. Test the authentication processes thoroughly to ensure they work as intended.
