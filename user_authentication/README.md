# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains JavaScript code (1212 characters) responsible for validating user input data for authentication purposes.
- **auth.py**: This Python file (2198 characters) handles the authentication logic for users, such as login, registration, and session management.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality, refer to `validator.js` and integrate the validation methods into your user input forms.
2. For authentication tasks, interact with the functions provided in `auth.py` to manage user login, registration, and session handling within the project.
