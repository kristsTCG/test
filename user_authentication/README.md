# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for authentication processes.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input to ensure data integrity and security. It plays a crucial role in preventing malicious input and maintaining data quality.
   
2. **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication logic using Python. This file is essential for ensuring secure access to the system.

## Usage
To utilize the functionality provided by the `user_authentication` folder, follow these steps:
1. Use the functions defined in `validator.js` to validate user input before processing it further.
2. Incorporate the authentication logic from `auth.py` to manage user login, registration, and authentication within the project.
3. Ensure that both files are integrated correctly with other components of the project to maintain a secure user authentication system.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** To use this file, import it into your project using `require` or `import` statements. Then, call the appropriate validation functions with the input you want to validate.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class managing user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token for active sessions.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by removing the session token from active sessions.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
