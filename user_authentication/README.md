# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` for client-side validation written in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This file contains client-side validation logic with 1212 characters. It is responsible for validating user input on the client side before sending it to the server for authentication.
   
2. `auth.py`: With 2198 characters, `auth.py` handles server-side authentication processes. It verifies user credentials, generates tokens, and manages user sessions on the server side.

## Usage
1. To utilize the client-side validation functionality, refer to `validator.js`. Modify or extend the validation rules as needed to suit the project requirements.
   
2. For server-side authentication tasks, interact with `auth.py`. Implement additional authentication logic or integrate it with existing authentication systems as necessary.
