- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters, responsible for validating user input.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters, handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file is crucial for ensuring that user input meets specified criteria and is safe for processing within the application.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file manages user authentication processes, such as login, logout, and user session management.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review `validator.js` to understand the validation rules applied to user input.
2. Explore `auth.py` to familiarize yourself with the user authentication logic.
3. Modify the code as needed to customize user authentication processes for your project.
