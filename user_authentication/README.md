# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side validation in JavaScript and auth.py for server-side authentication in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic with 1212 characters. It ensures that user input is valid before submitting it to the server.
- **auth.py**: With 2198 characters, this Python file manages server-side authentication processes. It handles user login, registration, and authentication.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**: Modify the validation rules as needed to suit the project's requirements. Ensure that the client-side validation logic aligns with the server-side validation rules.
2. **auth.py**: Implement additional authentication features or customize the existing ones based on the project's authentication requirements. Ensure that user authentication processes are secure and robust.

- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username (alphanumeric and underscores only).
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on various criteria.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class from `validator.js` and call the desired validation functions or password strength function.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py
