   - Modify the validation rules and error messages as needed.
   - Use the functions provided in `validator.js` to validate user input before submitting forms.

2. **auth.py**
   - Integrate the `auth.py` file with your server-side code to handle user authentication.
   - Customize the authentication logic to suit your project's requirements.
   - Securely store sensitive information such as passwords and tokens within `auth.py`.
