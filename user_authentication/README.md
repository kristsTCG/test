# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js** (JavaScript)
   - Role: Responsible for validating user input data.
   - Size: 1212 characters

2. **auth.py** (Python)
   - Role: Handles user authentication processes.
   - Size: 2198 characters

## Usage
Developers can utilize the `validator.js` file to ensure that user input data meets specified criteria. The `auth.py` file can be used to implement user authentication mechanisms within the project. Make sure to integrate these files into the appropriate parts of the project to enable secure user authentication.
