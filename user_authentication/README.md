# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized with two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file containing functions for validating user input.
- `auth.py`: A Python file implementing authentication logic for user login and access control.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file contains functions to validate user input, ensuring data integrity and security.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is responsible for handling user authentication processes, such as login, logout, and access control.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code and call the necessary functions to validate user input.
2. For user authentication functionalities, import `auth.py` into your Python code and use the provided functions for user login and access control.
