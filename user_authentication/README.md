# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized with two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file containing user input validation logic.
- `auth.py`: A Python file handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- Role: Responsible for validating user input data.
- Size: 1212 characters
- Language: JavaScript

### auth.py
- Role: Manages user authentication processes.
- Size: 2198 characters
- Language: Python

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation logic, refer to `validator.js` and integrate the validation functions into your user input forms.
2. For user authentication processes, interact with `auth.py` to authenticate users and manage their access to the system.

Ensure to follow the coding standards and guidelines set within these files for consistency and security in user authentication processes.
