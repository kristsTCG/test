# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. It includes code for validating user inputs and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: Responsible for validating user inputs.
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Language: JavaScript

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Manages user authentication processes.
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Language: Python

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality, refer to `validator.js`. This file contains functions to validate user inputs such as email addresses, passwords, etc.
2. For user authentication tasks, `auth.py` is the main file to work with. It handles processes like user login, registration, and authentication.
3. Ensure to follow the coding standards and conventions set in the existing files while making modifications or additions for user authentication features.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class managing user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.

- `logout`: Method to end a user's session by removing the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** To use this file, create an instance of the `UserAuth` class and call its methods for user registration, login, logout, and session validation.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib` for hashing functions.
- `json` for JSON handling.
- `datetime` for date and time operations.
- `timedelta` from `datetime` for time calculations.
- `typing` for type hints.
