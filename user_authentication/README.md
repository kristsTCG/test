# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input data related to authentication processes.
- **auth.py**: This Python file is 2198 characters long and handles the authentication logic for users within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionality in this folder, developers can interact with the `validator.js` and `auth.py` files. These files contain the necessary functions and logic to validate user input and authenticate users within the project. Developers can integrate these files into their codebase to enable secure user authentication processes.
