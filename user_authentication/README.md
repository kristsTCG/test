# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input related to authentication processes. It ensures that user-provided data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file is 2198 characters long and handles the authentication logic for users. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the application.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
- Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules for user input.
- Refer to the `auth.py` file to implement user authentication processes in the project.
- Ensure that both files are integrated correctly with other components that require user authentication functionalities.
