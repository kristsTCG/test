# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user data is correctly formatted before submission.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file handles server-side authentication processes. It manages user authentication, login, and session management within the application.

## Usage
1. To utilize the client-side validation logic, refer to `validator.js` for functions and methods related to input validation.
   
2. For server-side authentication tasks, interact with `auth.py` to implement user authentication, login functionality, and session management.

Ensure to maintain the integrity and security of user authentication processes by following best practices and security guidelines.
