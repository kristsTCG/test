# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains code for validating user inputs and ensuring data integrity during the authentication process. It plays a crucial role in verifying user credentials.
   
2. **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication logic. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes using Python programming language.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
1. Review the code in `validator.js` to understand how user input validation is implemented.
2. Explore `auth.py` to grasp the user authentication logic and how user credentials are managed.
3. Integrate these files into your project to enable secure user authentication processes.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username inputs, as well as determining the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username, allowing only alphanumeric characters and underscores within a specific length range.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character complexity.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the provided validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** User authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth` class: Manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password` method: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user` method: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login` method: Authenticates a user with a username and password, generates a session token.
- `logout` method: Ends a user's session based on the session token.
- `is_authenticated` method: Checks if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For handling JSON data.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
