# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling authentication processes. It includes functions for user login, registration, and authentication checks.

## Usage
To utilize the functionality provided in this folder:
1. Review the code in `validator.js` to understand the validation rules applied to user input.
2. Explore the functions in `auth.py` to implement user authentication features in your project.
3. Ensure to integrate these files with the rest of your project's codebase to enable user authentication capabilities effectively.
