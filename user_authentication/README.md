# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized with two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python. These files handle user input validation and authentication logic respectively.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This file contains the logic for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that the data entered by users meets the required criteria.
   
2. **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication within the system.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review `validator.js` to understand the validation rules applied to user input.
2. Examine `auth.py` to understand the authentication flow and processes implemented in the system.
3. Make necessary modifications to the code based on project requirements, ensuring that user input is validated and authenticated securely.
