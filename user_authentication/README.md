# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets specified criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
- `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication logic. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionality provided in this folder, developers can refer to the `validator.js` file for input validation requirements and use the `auth.py` file to implement user authentication processes in the project. Ensure to integrate these files into the project's authentication flow for secure user interactions.
