# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for authentication processes.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This file contains functions for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user data is accurate and secure.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication tasks within the project.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
- Use `validator.js` for validating user input before processing it further.
- Utilize `auth.py` for implementing user authentication functionalities such as login, registration, and authentication processes.
