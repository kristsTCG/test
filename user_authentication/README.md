# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication logic. It includes validator.js for client-side validation and auth.py for server-side authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation logic for user inputs. It plays a crucial role in ensuring data integrity and security on the client side.
- **auth.py**: This Python file is responsible for server-side authentication processes. It handles user login, registration, and authentication against the backend system.

## Usage
1. Use `validator.js` to implement client-side validation for user inputs to enhance user experience and prevent malicious data submissions.
2. Utilize `auth.py` to manage user authentication processes on the server side. This includes handling user login requests, registration, and verifying user credentials against the system.

Ensure to maintain the integrity and security of user authentication processes by following best practices and regularly updating the authentication logic in these files.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and a number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is between 3 to 20 characters long and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of the input password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** User authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class managing user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Register a new user with a unique username.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticate user and return a session token.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: End a user's session based on the session token.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to manage user authentication. Call `register_user` to add new users, `login` to authenticate users and get a session token, `logout` to end a session, and `is_authenticated` to check session validity.

**Dependencies:** `hashlib`, `json`, `datetime`, `timedelta`, `typing`.
