# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This folder handles validation and authentication processes for user accounts.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input data, such as email addresses, passwords, and other user credentials. It plays a crucial role in ensuring the integrity and security of user information.
  
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It includes functions for user login, logout, and session management. This file interacts with the database to authenticate users and authorize access to protected resources.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication features provided in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Use the functions defined in `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing.
2. Import and utilize the functions from `auth.py` to authenticate users during login and manage user sessions.
3. Ensure proper integration with the database for storing user credentials securely.
4. Implement appropriate error handling mechanisms to address authentication failures and user input validation errors.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file contains input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is 3-20 characters long, alphanumeric, and allows underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of the input password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class managing user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Import the `UserAuth` class from this file to handle user authentication in your Python application.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
