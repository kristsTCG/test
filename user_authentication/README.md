# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized with two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python. These files handle user input validation and authentication logic respectively.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
   
2. `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication logic. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the system.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
- Review `validator.js` for input validation functions and ensure that user data is validated before authentication.
- Utilize `auth.py` for implementing user authentication processes such as login, registration, and user session management.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username allowing alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** This file can be imported as a module to perform input validation for user authentication in a JavaScript application.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password()`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user()`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login()`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token for active sessions.
- `logout()`: Method to end a user session based on the session token.
- `is_authenticated()`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** To use this file, create an instance of the `UserAuth` class and call its methods for user registration, login, logout, and session validation.

**Dependencies:** The file imports `hashlib`, `json`, `datetime`, `timedelta`, and `Optional` and `Dict` types from the `typing` module.
