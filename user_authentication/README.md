# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This functionality is responsible for validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate the validation logic and authentication functionality into different files. It contains the following key components:
- `validator.js`: JavaScript file containing functions for validating user input.
- `auth.py`: Python file handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- Role: Responsible for validating user input.
- Size: 1212 characters
- Language: JavaScript

### auth.py
- Role: Handles user authentication processes.
- Size: 2198 characters
- Language: Python

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the necessary functions into your JavaScript files.
2. Use the validation functions provided in `validator.js` to validate user input before processing it further.
3. To implement user authentication processes, import and utilize the functions defined in `auth.py` in your Python code.
4. Ensure to follow the documentation and comments within each file for proper usage and integration with the rest of the project.
