# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This module handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side validation and auth.py for server-side authentication logic.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It ensures that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submitting to the server.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file auth.py is responsible for server-side authentication processes. It manages user authentication, login, and session handling within the application.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**: To use the client-side validation logic provided in validator.js, include this file in your HTML file using a script tag. You can then call the validation functions defined within this file to validate user input before submitting a form.

2. **auth.py**: To utilize the server-side authentication functionalities, import auth.py into your Python project. You can then call the authentication methods defined in this file to handle user login, authentication, and session management within your application. Make sure to configure the necessary settings and integrate the authentication logic with your application's user management system.
