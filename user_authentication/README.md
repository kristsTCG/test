# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This functionality is crucial for managing user access and security.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication logic using both JavaScript and Python. The key components include a validator script in JavaScript and an authentication module in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains logic for validating user input related to authentication. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user data is correctly formatted and secure.
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It likely includes functions for user login, registration, and password management.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation logic, refer to `validator.js` for functions related to validating user input fields such as email, password, etc.
2. For user authentication processes, interact with `auth.py` to implement login, registration, and other authentication-related functionalities within the project.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, username validation, and password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username allowing only alphanumeric characters and underscores within a specific length range.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types, returning a descriptive strength level.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to access the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file provides a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
