# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This module is responsible for validating user input and handling user authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` consists of two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file containing validation functions for user input. (1212 characters)
- `auth.py`: A Python file handling user authentication logic. (2198 characters)

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Role:** This file contains functions to validate user input data.
- **Usage:** Used to ensure that user input meets specified criteria before processing.

### auth.py
- **Role:** This file manages user authentication processes such as login, registration, and password handling.
- **Usage:** Handles user authentication logic within the project.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the necessary functions into your JavaScript files.
2. Use the validation functions provided in `validator.js` to validate user input data before further processing.
3. In Python scripts, import and utilize the functions in `auth.py` to handle user authentication processes within the project.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates a password based on specified criteria (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates a username for length (3-20 characters) and allowed characters (alphanumeric and underscores only).
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types, returning a descriptive strength level.

**Usage:** This file can be imported as a module to perform input validation in user authentication processes.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and generates a session token.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the provided session token.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to manage user authentication operations such as registration, login, and session handling.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON operations.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
