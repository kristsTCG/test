## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters of code and is responsible for validating user input data for authentication purposes.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file contains 2198 characters of code and manages the authentication process for users within the system.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionalities in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the code in `validator.js` to understand how user input data is validated.
2. Explore the code in `auth.py` to understand the authentication process for users.
3. Integrate these files into your project to enable user authentication features.
4. Ensure to handle errors and exceptions effectively when using these authentication components.
