# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to include two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python. These files are responsible for implementing the user authentication logic.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the data provided by the user meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file contains 2198 characters and is responsible for handling the authentication process. It verifies user credentials and grants access based on the authentication status.

## Usage
1. To utilize the user validation functionality, refer to `validator.js`. This file contains the necessary functions to validate user input data before proceeding with the authentication process.

2. To implement user authentication within the project, refer to `auth.py`. This file contains the authentication logic and functions to verify user credentials.

3. Ensure that both files are integrated into the project's authentication flow to provide a secure and reliable user authentication mechanism.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, username validation, and password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is between 3 to 20 characters long and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of the input password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the provided validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies required.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** This file can be imported to handle user authentication in Python applications.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: Used for hashing passwords.
- `json`: Not currently used but imported.
- `datetime`: Used for date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: Used for calculating expiration time for session tokens.
- `typing`: Used for type hinting.
