# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submission.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file handles server-side authentication processes. It manages user authentication, login, and access control within the system.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionality in this folder:
1. Modify the `validator.js` file to customize input validation rules as needed.
2. Implement the authentication logic in the `auth.py` file to secure user access to the system.
3. Ensure that both client-side and server-side validation processes are synchronized for a seamless user authentication experience.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file contains input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username (alphanumeric and underscores, 3-20 characters).
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class managing user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication processes.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib` for hashing functions.
- `json` for JSON serialization.
- `datetime` for handling date and time.
- `typing` for type hints.
