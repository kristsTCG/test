# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes a JavaScript file for validation logic and a Python file for authentication functionalities.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains the logic for validating user inputs and ensuring they meet the required criteria for authentication.
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes, such as verifying user credentials and granting access.

## Usage
To utilize the code in this folder:
1. Review `validator.js` for input validation rules and customize them as needed.
2. Use the functions provided in `auth.py` to authenticate users and manage access control within the project.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password and returns a descriptive level.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** User authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class managing user authentication operations.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Register a new user with username, email, and password.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticate user and return a session token.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: End a user session.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to manage user authentication. Call `register_user` to add a new user, `login` to authenticate and get a session token, `logout` to end a session, and `is_authenticated` to check session validity.

**Dependencies:** `hashlib`, `json`, `datetime`, `timedelta`, `Optional`, `Dict`.
