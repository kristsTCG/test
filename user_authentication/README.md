# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It handles validation and authentication of user credentials.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication processes efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data related to authentication. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling the authentication logic. It verifies user credentials and manages the authentication process within the system.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules and functions available.
2. Use the functions in `validator.js` to validate user input data before proceeding with authentication.
3. Refer to `auth.py` for authentication logic implementation and integrate it into the relevant parts of the project where user authentication is required.
4. Ensure that the functions from `validator.js` are appropriately utilized within the authentication process in `auth.py` to maintain data integrity and security.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively work with the user authentication code in this folder.
