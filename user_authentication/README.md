# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This module handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication features efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side validation and auth.py for server-side authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It ensures that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submission.
- **auth.py**: This Python file handles server-side authentication processes. It verifies user credentials and grants access based on authentication checks.

## Usage
1. To utilize the client-side validation provided by `validator.js`, include the file in your HTML code using a script tag.
2. Implement server-side authentication by importing and utilizing the functions defined in `auth.py` within your backend application.
3. Ensure to customize the validation criteria and authentication logic as per your project requirements.
