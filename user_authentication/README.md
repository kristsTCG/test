## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` contains two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters responsible for validating user input.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file is crucial for ensuring that user input meets specified criteria and is safe for processing within the system. It plays a key role in maintaining data integrity and security.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is essential for managing user authentication within the project. It handles processes such as user login, registration, and authentication checks.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review `validator.js` to understand the validation rules applied to user input.
2. Explore `auth.py` to grasp the authentication logic and processes implemented in the project.
3. Ensure to integrate these files appropriately within the broader project structure to enable secure user authentication functionalities.
