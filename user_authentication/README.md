# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This functionality is responsible for validating user input and managing user authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` consists of two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters that handles client-side validation of user input.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters that manages server-side user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Role**: Handles client-side validation of user input.
- **Character Count**: 1212
- **Usage**: Ensures that user input meets specified criteria before sending it to the server for authentication.

### auth.py
- **Role**: Manages server-side user authentication processes.
- **Character Count**: 2198
- **Usage**: Handles user authentication requests, verifies user credentials, and generates authentication tokens.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Modify the validation criteria in `validator.js` to suit the project's requirements.
2. Implement additional client-side validation logic as needed.
3. Utilize the functions in `auth.py` to authenticate users and manage authentication tokens on the server-side.
4. Ensure proper integration of these files with other components of the project that require user authentication functionality.
