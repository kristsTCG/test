# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` for client-side input validation in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication logic in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic written in JavaScript. It ensures that user input meets specified criteria before submission.
   
2. **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is responsible for server-side authentication tasks in Python. It manages user authentication, login, and session handling within the application.

## Usage
1. To utilize the client-side validation functionality, refer to `validator.js` and integrate the validation logic into your front-end forms.
   
2. For server-side authentication tasks, utilize the functions and methods defined in `auth.py` to handle user authentication and session management on the server side.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is 3-20 characters long and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of the input password based on length and character complexity.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For handling date and time.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
