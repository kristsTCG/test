# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication within the project. This functionality is crucial for managing user access and security.

## Structure
The folder consists of two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters, responsible for validating user input and ensuring data integrity.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters, handling authentication processes and user access control.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file is essential for validating user input data, ensuring that the information provided meets the required criteria and maintains data integrity.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file plays a critical role in managing user authentication within the project. It handles processes such as user login, registration, and access control.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review `validator.js` to understand the validation logic and criteria for user input.
2. Explore `auth.py` to familiarize yourself with the authentication processes and user access control mechanisms.
3. Modify the code as needed to customize the user authentication functionality for your project.
