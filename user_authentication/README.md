# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This module handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side validation and auth.py for server-side authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation logic for user inputs. It plays a crucial role in ensuring data integrity before submission.
- **auth.py**: The Python file auth.py is responsible for server-side authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication against the database.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication features:
1. Modify the validator.js file to customize client-side validation rules.
2. Implement additional server-side authentication logic in the auth.py file as needed.
3. Ensure proper integration with other parts of the project that require user authentication.
