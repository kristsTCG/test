- Size: 1212 characters
- Language: JavaScript

### auth.py
- Role: Manages user authentication processes.
- Size: 2198 characters
- Language: Python

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code and call the necessary functions for validating user input.
2. For user authentication processes, import `auth.py` into your Python code and utilize the functions provided for handling authentication tasks.
