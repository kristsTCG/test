# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user inputs and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` for client-side input validation in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication logic in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic for user inputs. It ensures that user-provided data meets specified criteria before submission.
- **auth.py**: This file handles server-side authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication using Python.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to suit the project requirements.
   - Include the script in your HTML files to enable client-side validation.
   
2. **auth.py**:
   - Implement additional authentication features such as two-factor authentication or password reset functionalities.
   - Integrate the authentication logic with your backend server to secure user access.

Ensure to test the functionality of both files thoroughly to maintain a secure and user-friendly authentication system.

- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on various criteria.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class in your code and call the validation methods as needed.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**

- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the provided authentication functions.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib` for hashing functions.
- `json` for JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime` for handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta` for calculating time differences.
- `typing` for type hints.
