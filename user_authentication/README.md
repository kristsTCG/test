# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication tasks within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder, developers can refer to the respective files for implementing user authentication features. Ensure that the `validator.js` file is used for validating user input, while `auth.py` should be utilized for managing user authentication processes. Developers can integrate these files into the project's authentication system as needed.
