# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file contains authentication logic written in Python. It manages user authentication processes such as login, registration, and session management.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file for validation functions and ensure they are integrated into the user input validation process.
2. Utilize the `auth.py` file to handle user authentication tasks within the project. This includes implementing login, registration, and session management functionalities.

Ensure that the code is properly integrated into the project and that any dependencies are correctly resolved for seamless user authentication processes.
