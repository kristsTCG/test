# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
- `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication logic.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
1. Review the code in `validator.js` to understand the validation rules applied to user input data.
2. Explore the logic in `auth.py` to implement user authentication processes within the project.
3. Integrate the validation and authentication functions from these files into your project as needed.
