# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized with two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file containing functions for validating user input.
- `auth.py`: A Python file responsible for handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- Role: Provides functions for validating user input data.
- Size: 1212 characters
- Language: JavaScript

### auth.py
- Role: Manages user authentication processes such as login, registration, and password management.
- Size: 2198 characters
- Language: Python

## Usage
1. To use the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the necessary functions into your JavaScript files and call them as needed to validate user input data.

2. For user authentication processes, utilize the functions and logic defined in `auth.py`. Import the relevant functions into your Python scripts to handle user login, registration, and password management securely.

3. Ensure to follow best practices for user authentication and data validation to enhance the security of the application.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file contains input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length and character requirements.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username, allowing alphanumeric characters and underscores only.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character complexity.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session by invalidating the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and not expired.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to manage user authentication operations like registration, login, and session handling.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints (not used in this file).
