# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling the authentication process. It includes functions for user login, registration, and authentication checks.

## Usage
To utilize the functionality provided in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation logic and criteria for user input.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to familiarize yourself with the authentication processes implemented in Python.
3. Integrate these files into your project as needed for user authentication tasks.

Remember to maintain the integrity of user data and ensure secure authentication practices when working with these files.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates an email address based on a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates a password to ensure it meets certain criteria (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates a username to ensure it is 3-20 characters long and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on its length and character composition.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use its validation methods in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** User authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Method to register a new user.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Method to authenticate a user and return a session token.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Method to end a user session.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Method to check if a session is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to manage user authentication. Use `register_user` to add new users, `login` to authenticate users and get a session token, `logout` to end a session, and `is_authenticated` to check session validity.

**Dependencies:** `hashlib`, `json`, `datetime`, `timedelta`, `Optional`, `Dict`
