# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submission.
  
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is responsible for server-side authentication processes. It manages user authentication, login, and authorization within the system.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review `validator.js` to understand the client-side validation rules and customize them as needed.
2. Explore `auth.py` to understand the server-side authentication logic and make any necessary adjustments to fit the project requirements.
3. Ensure that both files are integrated correctly within the project to maintain a secure and efficient user authentication system.
