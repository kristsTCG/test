# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. It includes a JavaScript file for validation logic and a Python file for handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to centralize all user authentication-related code. It currently consists of two key files: `validator.js` and `auth.py`.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains validation logic for user inputs related to authentication. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria for authentication processes.
   
2. `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for managing user authentication processes. It handles tasks such as user login, registration, and authentication checks.

## Usage
To utilize the functionality provided in this folder:
- Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules applied to user inputs.
- Examine the `auth.py` file to understand how user authentication processes are managed and implemented.
- Integrate these files into your project's authentication workflow as needed.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username (alphanumeric and underscores only).
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password and returns a corresponding level.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication process.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session based on the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib` for hashing functions.
- `json` for JSON serialization.
- `datetime` and `timedelta` from `datetime` module for date and time operations.
- `typing` for type hints.
