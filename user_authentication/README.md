# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder consists of two key files: `validator.js` and `auth.py`. These files are responsible for validating user input and managing user authentication in JavaScript and Python, respectively.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.

2. `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for managing user authentication within the project. It handles user login, registration, and authentication processes using Python programming language.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Use the functions defined in `validator.js` to validate user input data before proceeding with authentication processes.
2. Import and utilize the functions and classes defined in `auth.py` to manage user authentication within your project.
3. Ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed to support the execution of the code in these files.
4. Refer to the specific documentation within each file for detailed information on the available functions and classes.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username inputs, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates an email address based on a regular expression pattern.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates a password based on specific criteria (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates a username based on specific criteria (3-20 characters, alphanumeric and underscores only).
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the provided validation methods in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib` for hashing functions.
- `json` for JSON serialization.
- `datetime` for date and time operations.
- `timedelta` for time duration calculations.
- `typing` for type hints.
