## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes validation logic in JavaScript and authentication logic in Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks. It includes two key files: `validator.js` for input validation and `auth.py` for user authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters of code responsible for validating user input data.
- **auth.py**: This Python file contains 2198 characters of code that handle user authentication processes.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities in this folder:
1. Modify the validation rules in `validator.js` as needed for your project.
2. Implement the authentication logic in `auth.py` to suit your application's requirements.
3. Ensure to integrate these files with the rest of your project's authentication flow for a seamless user experience.
