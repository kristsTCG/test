# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for authentication logic.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This file contains functions for validating user input, ensuring that data entered by users meets specified criteria and is safe for processing.
   
2. `auth.py`: This file implements authentication logic for verifying user credentials and managing user sessions securely.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code and call the appropriate validation functions as needed.
   
2. For authentication tasks, import `auth.py` into your Python code and utilize the provided functions to authenticate users and manage user sessions securely.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the specified criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username meets the specified criteria.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength level of a given password based on length and character requirements.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class into your code and call the desired validation functions or password strength assessment function.

```javascript
const InputValidator = require('./validator.js');

const email = 'example@example.com';
const isEmailValid = InputValidator.validateEmail(email);

const password = 'StrongPassword123!';
const isPasswordValid = InputValidator.validatePassword(password);

const username = 'user123';
const isUsernameValid = InputValidator.validateUsername(username);

const passwordStrength = InputValidator.getPasswordStrength(password);
```

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token for active sessions.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by removing the session token from active sessions.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Import the `UserAuth` class from this file to handle user authentication in your Python application.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
