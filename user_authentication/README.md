# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user inputs and ensuring data integrity during the authentication process.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file contains 2198 characters and handles the authentication logic, including user login, registration, and session management.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the code in `validator.js` to understand the validation rules applied to user inputs.
2. Explore `auth.py` to familiarize yourself with the authentication logic and methods available for user authentication.
3. Integrate the necessary functions from these files into your project to enable user authentication features.

Ensure to maintain the integrity of user data and follow best practices for secure authentication processes.
