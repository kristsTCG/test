# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains code for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that the data provided by users meets the required criteria.
- **auth.py**: This file contains authentication logic written in Python. It manages user authentication processes such as login, logout, and user session management.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules applied to user input.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to understand the authentication logic implemented in Python.
3. Modify the code as needed to customize authentication functionalities for the project.
4. Ensure that any changes made adhere to security best practices to protect user data.
