# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder consists of two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file containing 1212 characters responsible for user input validation.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters that manage user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- Role: Handles user input validation.
- Size: 1212 characters
- Language: JavaScript

### auth.py
- Role: Manages user authentication processes.
- Size: 2198 characters
- Language: Python

## Usage
1. To use the validation functionality provided by `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code and call the appropriate validation functions as needed.
2. For user authentication processes, utilize the functions and methods defined in `auth.py` by importing the file into your Python project and invoking the necessary authentication functions.

Ensure that you follow the guidelines and conventions set within each file for seamless integration and proper functioning of the user authentication features.
