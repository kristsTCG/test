# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes to ensure secure access to the system.

## Structure
The folder is organized to centralize all user authentication-related code. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters of code responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.

2. `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` consists of 2198 characters of code dedicated to handling user authentication logic. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the system.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in the `user_authentication` folder:
1. Review the code in `validator.js` to understand the validation criteria for user input data.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to comprehend the user authentication processes implemented in Python.
3. Integrate these files into the project's authentication system as needed, ensuring proper validation and secure user authentication.
