# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file consists of 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input related to authentication. It ensures that the data entered by users meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file contains 2198 characters and handles the authentication logic for users. It manages the process of verifying user credentials and granting access to the system.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionality provided in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Use the `validator.js` file to validate user input for authentication-related fields.
2. Implement the authentication logic defined in the `auth.py` file to authenticate users and manage access to the system.

Ensure that you integrate these files into your project's authentication flow to enhance security and user verification processes.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength level of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class in your code and call the validation methods as needed.

```javascript
const InputValidator = require('./validator.js');

if (InputValidator.validateEmail('example@email.com')) {
    console.log('Email is valid');
}

const password = 'SecurePwd123!';
if (InputValidator.validatePassword(password)) {
    console.log('Password meets requirements');
}

const username = 'user123';
if (InputValidator.validateUsername(username)) {
    console.log('Username is valid');
}

const passwordStrength = InputValidator.getPasswordStrength(password);
console.log('Password strength:', passwordStrength);
```

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session by removing the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: Used for hashing passwords.
- `json`: Not used in this file but imported.
- `datetime`: Used for handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: Used for calculating expiration time for session tokens.
- `typing`: Used for type hinting in function definitions.
