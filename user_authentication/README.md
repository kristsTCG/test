# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder consists of two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file containing 1212 characters for validating user input.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters for handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file is responsible for validating user input within the authentication process. It ensures that the data provided by the user meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file contains functions and logic for user authentication. It manages the authentication flow, including verifying user credentials and granting access to authorized users.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality, refer to the `validator.js` file and integrate the validation methods into the user input forms.
2. For user authentication processes, utilize the functions and logic defined in the `auth.py` file. This includes verifying user credentials and managing user access within the application.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and a number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is 3-20 characters long, alphanumeric, and allows underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** This file can be imported using `require` or `import` statements to access the input validation functions.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the session token.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
