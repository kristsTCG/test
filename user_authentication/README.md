# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` for client-side validation written in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets specified criteria before submission.
   
2. `auth.py`: This file handles server-side authentication processes. It is responsible for verifying user credentials and managing user authentication within the system.

## Usage
1. To utilize the client-side validation functionality, refer to the `validator.js` file. Modify the validation rules as needed to suit the project requirements.
   
2. For server-side authentication tasks, interact with the `auth.py` file. Implement additional authentication logic or integrate it with other parts of the system as necessary.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is between 3-20 characters and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of the input password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication process.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user authentication operations.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token for active sessions.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by removing the session token from active sessions.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: For date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
