# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` and `auth.py`, written in JavaScript and Python, respectively.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.

2. **auth.py**: This Python file, 2198 characters in length, handles the authentication logic for users. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the system.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionality provided in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation criteria for user input data.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to grasp the authentication processes for user login and registration.
3. Integrate these files into your project to enable secure user authentication mechanisms.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength and format of a password (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username (3-20 characters, alphanumeric and underscores only).
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Register a new user with a unique username.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticate a user and return a session token.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: End a user session based on the session token.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to use the provided user authentication functionalities.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For representing time intervals.
- `typing`: For type hints.
