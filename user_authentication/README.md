- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file is crucial for ensuring that user input meets specified criteria before proceeding with authentication processes. It plays a key role in maintaining data integrity and security.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is essential for managing user authentication within the project. It handles user login, registration, and authentication processes, ensuring secure access to the system.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality, refer to the `validator.js` file and integrate the validation logic into your user input forms.
2. For user authentication processes, utilize the functions and methods provided in the `auth.py` file. Ensure to follow the authentication flow and security measures implemented within the file.

By following the guidelines outlined in the key files, you can effectively implement user authentication features in your project.
