# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes scripts for validating user input and handling user authentication using JavaScript and Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks. It contains two key files: `validator.js` for client-side input validation and `auth.py` for server-side authentication logic.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input on the client-side. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets specified criteria before submission.
   
2. `auth.py`: The Python script `auth.py` is responsible for handling server-side authentication processes. It manages user authentication, login, and authorization within the application.

## Usage
1. To utilize the client-side input validation functionality, refer to the `validator.js` file and incorporate the validation functions into your front-end code.
   
2. For server-side authentication tasks, interact with the `auth.py` script to implement user authentication logic on the backend. Ensure proper integration with your application's routing and authentication flow.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character requirements.

**Usage:** This file can be imported as a module using `require` or `import` statements to access the input validation functions.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, logout, and session validation.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Register a new user with a unique username.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticate user and return a session token.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: End a user session.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to manage user authentication operations. Call `register_user` to add a new user, `login` to authenticate and get a session token, `logout` to end a session, and `is_authenticated` to check session validity.

**Dependencies:** `hashlib`, `json`, `datetime`, `timedelta`, `typing`.
