# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication within the project. This functionality is crucial for managing user access and security.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks. It includes validator.js for client-side validation logic in JavaScript and auth.py for server-side authentication in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It plays a key role in ensuring data integrity and security on the front end.
- **auth.py**: The auth.py file is responsible for server-side authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication, ensuring secure access to the system.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**: Modify this file to add or update client-side validation rules as needed for user input fields.
2. **auth.py**: Use this file to customize server-side authentication logic, such as integrating with a database or external authentication services. Ensure proper error handling and security measures are in place.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username, allowing alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password and returns a descriptive level.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** User authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class managing user authentication operations.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Register a new user with a unique username.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticate user and return a session token.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: End a user session.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to manage user authentication. Call `register_user` to add new users, `login` to authenticate users and get a session token, `logout` to end a session, and `is_authenticated` to check session validity.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON encoding/decoding.
- `datetime`: For handling date and time.
- `timedelta`: For time-related calculations.
- `typing`: For type hints.
