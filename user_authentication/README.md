# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate the validation logic in `validator.js` written in JavaScript and the authentication logic in `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This file contains the validation logic for user inputs. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
- `auth.py`: This file handles the authentication process for users. It verifies user credentials and grants access based on the authentication results.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality, refer to `validator.js` and integrate the validation logic into the user input forms.
2. For user authentication, utilize `auth.py` to authenticate users based on their credentials. Ensure to handle authentication responses appropriately in your application logic.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets complexity requirements.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username meets specified criteria.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength level of a given password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class in your code and call the validation functions as needed.

```javascript
const InputValidator = require('./validator.js');

if (InputValidator.validateEmail('example@email.com')) {
    // Email is valid
}

if (InputValidator.validatePassword('StrongPass123')) {
    // Password meets complexity requirements
}

const strengthLevel = InputValidator.getPasswordStrength('SecurePass123');
console.log(strengthLevel); // Output: 'Strong'
```

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that handles user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization/deserialization.
- `datetime`: For handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
