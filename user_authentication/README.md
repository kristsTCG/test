# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Language: JavaScript
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Role: Responsible for validating user input data related to authentication. This file ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria for authentication.

2. **auth.py**
   - Language: Python
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Role: Manages the authentication process for users. This file handles user login, registration, and authentication tasks using Python.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality, refer to `validator.js`. Modify the validation rules as needed to suit the project's requirements.
2. For user authentication tasks, interact with `auth.py`. Implement user login, registration, and authentication processes using the functions provided in this file.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing password using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization/deserialization.
