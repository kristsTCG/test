# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submission.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python file handles server-side authentication processes. It manages user authentication, login, and authorization within the system.

## Usage
1. To utilize the client-side validation logic, refer to `validator.js` and integrate the validation functions into your front-end forms.
   
2. For server-side authentication tasks, make use of `auth.py` to handle user login, authentication, and authorization processes within the backend of the project.
