# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication logic using different programming languages. Currently, it includes a JavaScript file for validation (`validator.js`) and a Python file for authentication (`auth.py`).

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication within the system.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in the `user_authentication` folder, follow these steps:
1. Refer to `validator.js` for user input validation functions and integrate them into the relevant parts of the project where input validation is required.
2. Utilize `auth.py` for user authentication processes such as user login, registration, and authentication. Ensure to import and use the necessary functions in your project to enable secure user authentication.

By following the guidelines outlined in the key files, you can enhance the user authentication mechanisms in your project effectively.
