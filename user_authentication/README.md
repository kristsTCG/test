# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python file handles the authentication process. It includes functions for user login, registration, and password management. The authentication logic is implemented here.

## Usage
1. Use `validator.js` to validate user input before processing authentication requests. Import the necessary functions and call them as needed in your authentication flow.

2. Utilize `auth.py` for implementing user authentication features. Import the file and call the relevant functions for tasks such as user login, registration, and password management.

3. Ensure to maintain the integrity of the authentication process by following the guidelines and logic defined in these files. Make necessary adjustments or enhancements based on project requirements.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is between 3 to 20 characters long and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** This file can be imported using `require` or `import` statements in Node.js or browser environments to perform input validation for user authentication.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class managing user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token for active sessions.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by removing the session token from active sessions.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and not expired.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize user registration, login, and session management functionalities.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: For handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
