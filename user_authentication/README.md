# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It ensures that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submission.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file handles server-side authentication processes. It manages user authentication, login, and session management within the application.

## Usage
1. To utilize the client-side validation functionality, modify the `validator.js` file to add or customize validation rules as needed.
   
2. For server-side authentication tasks, interact with the `auth.py` file to integrate user authentication processes into the project. Ensure to follow the existing logic and adapt it to suit the project requirements.
