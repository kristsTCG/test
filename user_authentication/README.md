# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the data provided by users meet the required criteria for authentication.

2. **auth.py**: This Python file contains 2198 characters and handles the authentication logic for users. It verifies user credentials and grants access based on the authentication process.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in the `user_authentication` folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation criteria for user input data.
2. Examine the `auth.py` file to understand the authentication logic implemented for user authentication.
3. Integrate the validation and authentication processes into your project as needed.
4. Ensure to handle errors and edge cases effectively to enhance the security of user authentication.
