# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.

2. **auth.py**: This Python file is 2198 characters long and handles the authentication logic for users. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation criteria for user input data.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to understand how user authentication processes are handled.
3. Integrate these files into your project to enable user authentication features effectively.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username.

  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the session token.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: Used for hashing passwords.
- `json`: Used for JSON serialization and deserialization.
