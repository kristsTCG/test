# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It likely includes functions for user login, registration, and authentication.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation logic and criteria for user input data.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to familiarize yourself with the user authentication processes implemented in Python.
3. Integrate these files into your project to enable user authentication features securely.
