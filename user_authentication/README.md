# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: Responsible for validating user input data.
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Language: JavaScript

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Manages the authentication process for users.
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Language: Python

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication features provided in this folder:
1. Use `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing it further.
2. Incorporate `auth.py` to handle user authentication tasks such as login, registration, and session management.

Ensure to understand the logic implemented in each file to effectively integrate user authentication functionalities into the project.
