# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for authentication logic.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It contains functions and logic for verifying user credentials and granting access to authorized users.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - To use the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code.
   - Call the appropriate validation functions with user input data to ensure it meets the required criteria.
   - Customize the validation rules as needed for your project.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Import `auth.py` into your Python code to access the authentication logic.
   - Utilize the provided functions to authenticate users based on their credentials.
   - Implement additional security measures or customizations as per your project requirements.

Ensure to handle errors and exceptions gracefully while working with the user authentication functionality in this folder.
