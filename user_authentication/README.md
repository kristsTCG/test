## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user inputs and ensuring data integrity during the authentication process.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file consists of 2198 characters and manages the authentication logic, including user login, registration, and session management.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in the `user_authentication` folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules and implement any necessary changes to suit your project requirements.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to familiarize yourself with the authentication logic and customize it as needed for your application.
3. Integrate the user authentication features from these files into your project by importing the necessary functions and classes.
4. Test the authentication processes thoroughly to ensure they function correctly and securely within your application.
