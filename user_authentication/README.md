- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters, responsible for validating user input data.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters, responsible for handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Role**: Validates user input data.
- **Character Count**: 1212
- **Usage**: Ensures that user-provided data meets specified criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.

### auth.py
- **Role**: Handles user authentication processes.
- **Character Count**: 2198
- **Usage**: Manages user login, registration, and authentication functionalities.

## Usage
1. Ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed to run the code in this folder.
2. Use `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing it further.
3. Utilize `auth.py` for user authentication processes such as login, registration, and authentication.
4. Follow the code structure and comments within each file for better understanding and maintenance.

Remember to handle sensitive user data securely and follow best practices for user authentication to ensure the security of the application.
