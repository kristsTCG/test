# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This module handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side validation and auth.py for server-side authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation logic for user inputs. It ensures that user-provided data meets specified criteria before submission.
- **auth.py**: This Python file is responsible for server-side authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication against the system.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Modify `validator.js` to customize client-side validation rules as needed.
2. Update `auth.py` to enhance server-side authentication logic or integrate with external authentication services.
3. Ensure that both files are integrated correctly within the project to maintain secure user authentication processes.
