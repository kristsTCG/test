# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` and `auth.py`.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input data for authentication purposes.
- `auth.py`: This Python file contains 2198 characters and handles the authentication logic for users within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the authentication functionalities provided by this folder:
1. Modify the `validator.js` file to customize user input validation rules.
2. Implement the authentication logic in the `auth.py` file to manage user authentication processes.
3. Ensure proper integration of these files with other components of the project that require user authentication.
