## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It includes scripts for validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: Responsible for validating user input data.
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Language: JavaScript

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Manages user authentication processes.
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Language: Python

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - To use the validator script, import it into your JavaScript file:
     ```javascript
     import validator from './validator.js';
     ```
   - Call the validation functions as needed in your code:
     ```javascript
     validator.validateEmail(email);
     validator.validatePassword(password);
     ```

2. **auth.py**:
   - To utilize the authentication functionalities, import the `auth` module in your Python script:
     ```python
     from auth import authenticate_user, create_user, reset_password
     ```
   - Use the provided functions for user authentication tasks:
     ```python
     authenticate_user(username, password)
     create_user(username, password)
     reset_password(username)
     ```

Ensure to follow the appropriate usage guidelines and integrate these files into your project's user authentication system effectively.
