# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input data for authentication purposes.
- `auth.py`: This Python file is 2198 characters long and handles the authentication logic for users within the project.

## Usage
Developers can utilize the `validator.js` file to ensure that user input data meets the required criteria for authentication. The `auth.py` file can be used to implement authentication processes for users in the project. Ensure to follow the code structure and guidelines within each file for seamless integration and functionality.
