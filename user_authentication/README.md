# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes validation logic in JavaScript and authentication logic in Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks. It contains two key files: `validator.js` for input validation and `auth.py` for user authentication.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains logic for validating user inputs. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria.
  
- `auth.py`: This Python file handles user authentication processes. It is responsible for verifying user credentials and managing user sessions.

## Usage
1. To use the validation logic provided in `validator.js`, import the functions into your JavaScript files and call them to validate user inputs.

2. For user authentication tasks, import the necessary functions from `auth.py` into your Python files. Use these functions to authenticate users and manage their sessions securely.
