## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input data related to authentication. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file is 2198 characters long and handles the authentication logic for users. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in the `user_authentication` folder, follow these steps:
1. Use the `validator.js` file to validate user input data before processing it for authentication purposes.
2. Utilize the `auth.py` file to implement user authentication logic such as login, registration, and authentication processes in your project.
