# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized with two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters responsible for validating user input.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file contains functions for validating user input, ensuring data integrity and security within the authentication process.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file manages user authentication functionalities such as login, logout, and user session management. It plays a crucial role in securing user access to the system.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code and call the necessary validation functions as needed.
2. For user authentication processes, import `auth.py` into your Python code and utilize its functions for user login, logout, and session management.

Ensure to follow best practices for user authentication and data validation to maintain system security and integrity.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of being at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and a number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is between 3 to 20 characters long and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on its length and character composition.

**Usage:** To use this file, import it into your JavaScript code using `require` or `import` statements, then call the desired validation functions as needed.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies are required for this file.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the session token.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: Used for hashing passwords.
- `json`: Not used in this file but imported.
- `datetime`: Used for working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: Used for calculating time differences.
- `typing`: Used for type hints.
