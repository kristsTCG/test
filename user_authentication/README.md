# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input data related to authentication. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file is 2198 characters long and handles the authentication logic for users. It manages the authentication process, including verifying user credentials and granting access to authorized users.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionality in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules for user input data.
2. Study the `auth.py` file to comprehend the authentication process and how user credentials are verified.
3. Integrate these files into the project's authentication system as needed, ensuring proper error handling and security measures are in place.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength evaluation.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username, allowing alphanumeric characters and underscores within a specific length range.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Evaluates the strength of a password based on length and character complexity, returning a descriptive strength level.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the provided validation methods in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the session token.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to manage user authentication operations. Call `register_user` to add new users, `login` to authenticate users and generate session tokens, `logout` to end user sessions, and `is_authenticated` to verify session validity.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing.Optional`, `typing.Dict`: For type hints.
