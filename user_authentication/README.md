# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input, ensuring data integrity and security within the authentication process.
- `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` handles user authentication logic, such as verifying user credentials and managing user sessions.

## Usage
To utilize the functionality within this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file for input validation functions and integrate them into your user authentication flow.
2. Study the `auth.py` file to understand the authentication logic and implement it in your project as needed.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class in your code where input validation is needed:
```javascript
const InputValidator = require('./validator.js');
```

**Dependencies:** No notable dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** User authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class managing user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Register a new user with a unique username, email, and hashed password.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticate user with username and password, returning a session token.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: End a user session based on the provided session token.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to manage user authentication operations. Call `register_user` to add new users, `login` to authenticate users and get session tokens, `logout` to end user sessions, and `is_authenticated` to verify session validity.

**Dependencies:** `hashlib`, `json`, `datetime`, `timedelta`, `typing`.
