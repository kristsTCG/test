# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` for client-side input validation written in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: Responsible for client-side input validation.
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Language: JavaScript

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Handles server-side authentication processes.
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Language: Python

## Usage
1. **validator.js**
   - Ensure the `validator.js` file is included in your project's frontend code.
   - Use the functions provided in `validator.js` to validate user input on the client side before submitting forms.

2. **auth.py**
   - Integrate the `auth.py` file into your backend codebase.
   - Utilize the authentication functions in `auth.py` to manage user login, registration, and authentication processes on the server side.

Remember to maintain consistency between client-side validation and server-side authentication to ensure a secure and user-friendly authentication system.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates a username for length and character restrictions.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class where input validation is needed.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token for active sessions.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by removing the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication. Call `register_user` to add new users, `login` to authenticate users and generate session tokens, `logout` to end user sessions, and `is_authenticated` to check session validity.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib` for hashing functions.
- `json` for JSON serialization.
- `datetime` for date and time operations.
- `timedelta` for time duration calculations.
- `typing` for type hints.
