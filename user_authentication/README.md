## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` contains two key files:
1. `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters, responsible for validating user input data.
2. `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters, responsible for handling user authentication logic.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Role**: Validates user input data.
- **Character Count**: 1212

### auth.py
- **Role**: Handles user authentication logic.
- **Character Count**: 2198

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality, refer to the `validator.js` file and integrate the validation methods into your user input forms.
2. For user authentication processes, refer to the `auth.py` file and incorporate the authentication logic into your application's authentication flow.

Ensure to maintain the integrity and security of user data throughout the authentication processes.
