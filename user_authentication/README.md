# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` for client-side input validation using JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication logic using Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: Responsible for client-side input validation.
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Language: JavaScript

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Handles server-side authentication processes.
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Language: Python

## Usage
1. **validator.js**
   - To use the client-side input validation:
     - Include `validator.js` in your HTML file.
     - Call the validation functions as needed in your front-end scripts.

2. **auth.py**
   - To utilize the server-side authentication logic:
     - Import `auth.py` in your Python backend code.
     - Implement the authentication functions provided in `auth.py` for user authentication processes.

Ensure to maintain the integrity of the authentication mechanisms and follow best practices for secure user authentication.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the format of a password (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username (3-20 characters, alphanumeric and underscores only).
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user authentication operations.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by invalidating the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** This file can be imported to implement user authentication in Python applications.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: Used for hashing passwords.
- `json`: Used for JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: Used for date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: Used for time duration calculations.
- `typing`: Used for type hints (not used in this file).
