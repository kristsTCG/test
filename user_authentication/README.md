## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It is responsible for validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes the following key components:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters that handles input validation for user authentication.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters that manages user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- Role: Responsible for validating user input for authentication purposes.
- Size: 1212 characters

### auth.py
- Role: Manages user authentication processes such as login, registration, and authentication checks.
- Size: 2198 characters

## Usage
1. To utilize the input validation functionality, refer to `validator.js`. This file contains functions to validate user input before proceeding with authentication processes.

2. For user authentication tasks such as login, registration, and authentication checks, interact with `auth.py`. This file encapsulates the logic for handling these processes effectively.

3. Ensure to maintain the integrity of the codebase by following the established conventions and guidelines within the `user_authentication` folder.
