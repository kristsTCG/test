# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This file contains functions to validate user input for authentication purposes. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user data is correctly formatted and secure.
- `auth.py`: This Python file implements the authentication logic for users. It handles user login, registration, and authorization processes.

## Usage
1. To use the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code and call the appropriate validation functions as needed.
2. For user authentication tasks, utilize the functions and classes defined in `auth.py`. This includes handling user login, registration, and authorization checks.

Ensure to follow the documentation within each file for specific usage instructions and function details.
