# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate the validation logic in `validator.js` written in JavaScript and the authentication logic in `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains the validation logic for user inputs. It ensures that the data entered by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file handles the authentication process for users. It verifies user credentials and grants access based on the authentication rules defined within the file.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality, refer to `validator.js` and integrate the validation logic into the user input forms.
2. For user authentication, utilize `auth.py` to authenticate user credentials and manage user access within the project.
3. Ensure to maintain the integrity of the authentication process to secure user data and access rights effectively.
