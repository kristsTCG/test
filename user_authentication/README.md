   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Language: JavaScript

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Manages user authentication processes.
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Language: Python

## Usage
1. **validator.js**
   - To use the `validator.js` script, import it into your JavaScript file using `require('./validator.js')`.
   - Utilize the functions provided in `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing it further.

2. **auth.py**
