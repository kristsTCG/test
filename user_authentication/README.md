# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: Responsible for validating user input.
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Language: JavaScript

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Handles user authentication processes.
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Language: Python

## Usage
1. To use the `validator.js` file:
   - Ensure the file is included in the appropriate part of your project.
   - Call the validation functions as needed to validate user input.

2. To work with `auth.py`:
   - Import the file into your Python project.
   - Utilize the authentication functions provided to authenticate users within your application.

Remember to handle errors and exceptions appropriately when integrating these files into your project.
