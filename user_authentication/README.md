# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input, ensuring data integrity and security in the authentication process.
- `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication logic, such as verifying user credentials and managing user sessions.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder, developers can refer to the respective files for implementing user authentication features in the project. They can integrate the validation functions from `validator.js` to ensure data integrity and security in user input. Additionally, the authentication logic in `auth.py` can be used to authenticate users and manage their sessions within the application.
