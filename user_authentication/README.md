# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` for client-side validation written in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: Handles client-side validation for user inputs.
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Language: JavaScript

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Manages server-side authentication processes.
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Language: Python

## Usage
1. **validator.js**
   - Ensure the `validator.js` file is included in your project's frontend codebase.
   - Use the functions provided in `validator.js` to validate user inputs on the client side before submitting forms.

2. **auth.py**
   - Integrate `auth.py` into your backend codebase.
   - Utilize the functions in `auth.py` to authenticate users, manage sessions, and handle user login/logout processes.

Remember to maintain the integrity and security of user authentication processes by following best practices and keeping these files up to date with any security patches or improvements.
