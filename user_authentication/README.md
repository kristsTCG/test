# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` for client-side input validation written in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication logic written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation functions to ensure that user input meets specified criteria before submission.
2. **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file handles server-side authentication processes, such as verifying user credentials and managing user sessions.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**: To use the validation functions provided in `validator.js`, import the necessary functions into your client-side scripts and call them as needed to validate user input.
   
   Example:
   ```javascript
   import { validateEmail, validatePassword } from './validator.js';
   
   if (validateEmail(emailInput.value)) {
       // Email input is valid
   } else {
       // Email input is invalid
   }
   ```

2. **auth.py**: Utilize the authentication functionalities provided in `auth.py` by importing the necessary functions into your server-side scripts and integrating them into your authentication workflows.
   
   Example:
   ```python
   from auth import authenticate_user, create_session
   
   if authenticate_user(username, password):
       session_id = create_session(username)
       # User authenticated, create session for the user
   else:
       # Authentication failed
   ```

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character requirements.

**Usage:** This file can be imported into other JavaScript files using `require` or `import` statements to access the input validation functionalities provided by the `InputValidator` class.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to use the provided authentication functionalities.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization/deserialization.
- `datetime`: For handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
