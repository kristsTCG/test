# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for authentication processes.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that the data entered by users meets the required criteria.
- `auth.py`: This file handles authentication processes such as user login, registration, and password management. It is responsible for verifying user credentials and managing user sessions.

## Usage
1. To use the validation functionalities provided by `validator.js`, import the necessary functions into your JavaScript files and call them to validate user input data.
2. For authentication processes, utilize the functions defined in `auth.py` to handle user login, registration, and password-related tasks. Ensure proper integration with other parts of the project that require user authentication.
