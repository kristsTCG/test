# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for client-side validation and `auth.py` written in Python for server-side authentication.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: Responsible for client-side validation of user input.
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Language: JavaScript

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Handles server-side authentication processes.
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Language: Python

## Usage
1. **validator.js**
   - Ensure that the `validator.js` file is included in your project's frontend code.
   - Use the functions within `validator.js` to validate user input on forms before submission.

2. **auth.py**
   - Integrate `auth.py` into your server-side codebase.
   - Utilize the authentication functions provided in `auth.py` to manage user authentication processes securely.

Remember to maintain the integrity of user authentication by following best practices and keeping these files up to date with any security enhancements.
