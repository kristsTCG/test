# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is structured to manage user authentication operations efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains code for validating user input and ensuring data integrity during the authentication process.
- `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` handles the authentication logic, including user login, registration, and token generation.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review `validator.js` to understand how user input validation is implemented.
2. Explore `auth.py` to grasp the authentication flow, including user registration, login, and token generation.
3. Modify the code as needed to integrate user authentication features into the project.
4. Ensure to maintain data security and follow best practices for user authentication.
