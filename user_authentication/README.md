# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` contains two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters, responsible for validating user input data.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters, handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
The `validator.js` file is crucial for ensuring that user input data is valid before proceeding with authentication processes. It contains functions for validating various types of user input, such as email addresses, passwords, and other relevant data.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is essential for managing user authentication within the project. It includes functions for user login, registration, password hashing, and token generation. This file plays a vital role in securing user accounts and ensuring authentication processes are robust.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation logic and functions available for validating user input.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to familiarize yourself with the user authentication processes implemented in the project.
3. Use the functions provided in these files to handle user authentication tasks effectively within the project.
