# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It includes validation logic in JavaScript and authentication logic in Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication processes. It includes two key files, `validator.js` for input validation and `auth.py` for user authentication.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters of code responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.

2. **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file, written in Python and comprising 2198 characters, handles user authentication within the system. It verifies user credentials and grants access based on the authentication process.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionalities in this folder:
1. Review the code in `validator.js` to understand the input validation criteria.
2. Examine the code in `auth.py` to understand the authentication process and how user credentials are verified.
3. Integrate these files into your project's authentication flow as needed, ensuring proper validation and authentication of user data.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file contains input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username, allowing only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** This file can be imported into other JavaScript files using `require` or `import` statements, and then the functions can be called directly with the appropriate inputs.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies are required for this file.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib` for hashing functions.
- `json` for JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime` for working with dates and times.
- `timedelta` for representing differences between dates or times.
- `typing` for type hints.
