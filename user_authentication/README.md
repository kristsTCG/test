# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` contains two key files: `validator.js` and `auth.py`. These files handle user input validation and authentication processes, respectively.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python file implements the authentication logic for verifying user credentials and granting access to the system. It manages user authentication processes securely.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - To use the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code.
   - Call the appropriate validation functions provided in `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing it further.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Import `auth.py` into your Python code to access the authentication functionalities.
   - Utilize the authentication methods defined in `auth.py` to authenticate users based on their credentials.
   - Ensure proper error handling and security measures are in place while integrating the authentication logic into your project.

Ensure to follow best practices for user authentication and data validation to enhance the security of your application.
