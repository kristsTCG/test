# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. It handles validation and authentication processes for user accounts.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate the validation logic in `validator.js` written in JavaScript and the authentication logic in `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This file contains the validation logic for user inputs. It ensures that user data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
- `auth.py`: This file handles the authentication process for user accounts. It verifies user credentials and grants access based on the authentication rules.

## Usage
1. To use the validation functionality, refer to `validator.js`. Modify the validation rules as needed to suit the project requirements.
2. For user authentication, utilize `auth.py`. Implement the authentication process by calling the necessary functions and methods provided in the file.
3. Ensure that both files are integrated into the project's authentication flow to secure user accounts effectively.
