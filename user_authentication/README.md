# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized with two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file containing functions for validating user input. (1212 characters)
- `auth.py`: A Python file responsible for handling user authentication processes. (2198 characters)

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file contains functions for validating user input to ensure data integrity and security.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file manages user authentication processes such as login, logout, and user session management.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review `validator.js` to understand the validation functions available for user input.
2. Explore `auth.py` to understand and utilize the user authentication processes provided.
3. Ensure to integrate these files into the project's authentication flow as needed.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username inputs, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and a number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is between 3-20 characters and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of the input password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication process.

**Dependencies:** None

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and hashed password.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token if successful.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the provided session token.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations like registration, login, and session handling.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib` for password hashing.
- `json` for JSON serialization (not used in the provided code snippet).
- `datetime` for working with dates and times.
- `timedelta` for calculating time differences.
- `typing.Optional` for type hinting.
