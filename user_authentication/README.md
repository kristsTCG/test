# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes scripts for validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` for client-side input validation using JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication logic using Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: Responsible for validating user input on the client-side.
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Language: JavaScript

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Manages server-side authentication processes.
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Language: Python

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Ensure the script is linked to the appropriate HTML file.
   - Customize validation rules as needed by modifying the script.
   - Use functions provided in the script to validate user input before submission.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Integrate the authentication logic into the server-side codebase.
   - Implement necessary security measures to protect user data.
   - Utilize functions in `auth.py` for user authentication and authorization processes.

Remember to test the user authentication functionalities thoroughly to ensure a secure and seamless user experience.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is 3-20 characters long, alphanumeric, and contains underscores only.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of the input password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token for active sessions.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by removing the session token from active sessions.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Import the `UserAuth` class from this file to incorporate user authentication features into your Python application.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
