# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` for client-side input validation using JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication using Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file is crucial for validating user input on the client-side. It contains functions to ensure that user-provided data meets specified criteria before submission.
   
2. **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file handles server-side authentication processes using Python. It includes functions for user login, registration, and authentication checks.

## Usage
1. To utilize the client-side validation functionality, refer to `validator.js` and integrate the validation functions into your front-end forms.
   
2. For server-side authentication tasks, utilize the functions provided in `auth.py` to manage user authentication processes within your project. Ensure to handle authentication securely to protect user data.

- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username allowing alphanumeric characters and underscores within a specific length range.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character complexity.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class where input validation is needed and call the respective validation methods.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
