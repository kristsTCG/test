# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**:
   - Language: JavaScript
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Role: This file is responsible for validating user input data to ensure it meets the required criteria for authentication.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Language: Python
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Role: This file contains the authentication logic for verifying user credentials and managing user sessions.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
1. Modify the validation rules in `validator.js` to suit the specific requirements of the project.
2. Implement the authentication logic defined in `auth.py` to authenticate users securely.
3. Ensure that both files are integrated seamlessly with other components of the project that require user authentication.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username for alphanumeric characters and underscores within a specific length range.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** To use this file, create an instance of `UserAuth` and call its methods for user registration, login, logout, and session validation.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
