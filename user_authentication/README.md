## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input data for authentication purposes.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file contains 2198 characters and handles the authentication logic for users, including login, registration, and session management.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file for user input validation rules.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to understand the authentication logic and implement necessary changes for user authentication processes.
