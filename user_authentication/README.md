# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files are responsible for validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling the authentication process. It manages user login, registration, and authentication tasks within the project.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
- Review `validator.js` for validation functions and ensure they meet the project's requirements.
- Understand the logic and flow of the authentication process by examining `auth.py`.
- Integrate these files into the project's authentication system as needed.
- Test the authentication functionalities thoroughly to ensure they work as expected.
