# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It includes validation logic in JavaScript and authentication logic in Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks. The key components include a validator script in JavaScript and an authentication module in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains validation logic for user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
- `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication tasks. It includes functions for user login, registration, and session management.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation logic in `validator.js`, import the script into your JavaScript files where user input validation is required. Use the functions provided in `validator.js` to validate user data before processing it further.
   
2. For user authentication tasks, import the `auth.py` module into your Python scripts. Use the functions within `auth.py` to handle user login, registration, and session management functionalities in your project. Ensure to follow the documentation within `auth.py` for proper usage.

3. Maintain the integrity and security of user data by consistently using the validation and authentication functionalities provided in this folder. Regularly update and review the code to address any security vulnerabilities or improvements needed in the authentication process.
