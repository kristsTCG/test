# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. This module is responsible for validating user input and handling user authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` consists of two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters, responsible for input validation.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters, handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- Role: Responsible for input validation.
- Size: 1212 characters

### auth.py
- Role: Handles user authentication processes.
- Size: 2198 characters

## Usage
1. To use the input validation functionality, refer to `validator.js`. Customize the validation rules as needed for your project.
2. For user authentication processes, utilize `auth.py`. Implement the necessary authentication logic and integrate it with your project's user management system.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username allowing only alphanumeric characters and underscores within a specific length range.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
    - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
    - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
    - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and generates a session token.
    - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the provided session token.
    - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization/deserialization.
- `datetime`: For handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
