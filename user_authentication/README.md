# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling the authentication logic. It manages user authentication processes such as login, logout, and user session management.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Use the functions provided in `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing it for authentication.
2. Utilize the authentication logic implemented in `auth.py` to manage user authentication processes within the project.
3. Ensure that both files are integrated correctly with other components of the project that require user authentication functionalities.
