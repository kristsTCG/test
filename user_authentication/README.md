## auth.py

### 📊 Business Context & Impact
**Business Problem Statement:**
- This file provides a user authentication system with login and registration functionality, addressing the need for secure user access control within the organization.
- It helps in ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive information or perform specific actions on the system.
- The file delivers value by safeguarding user accounts and data from unauthorized access, enhancing overall system security.

**Stakeholder Analysis:**
- Primary users include system administrators, developers, and end-users who need to authenticate and manage user accounts.
- Business processes such as user account creation, login, and session management depend on this code for secure access control.
- The file is a critical component in the organization's security infrastructure, ensuring compliance with data protection regulations and safeguarding sensitive information.

### 🏗️ Technical Architecture  
**System Design:**
- The file follows a modular design pattern with separate functions for user registration, login, session management, and authentication checks.
- It applies principles of data encryption and secure password hashing to protect user credentials.
- Dependencies include hashlib for cryptographic hashing and datetime for timestamp management.
- The file integrates with other system components by providing secure user authentication services.

**Data Architecture:**
- Data models include user information stored in a dictionary format within the `users` attribute and active session data in the `active_sessions` attribute.
- Database interactions are not directly performed in this file; instead, user data is stored in-memory.
- Data validation ensures that user inputs are correctly processed and stored securely.
- Input/output specifications involve handling user credentials, session tokens, and timestamps for authentication purposes.

**Performance & Scalability:**
- The code has low resource usage due to in-memory data storage and efficient hashing algorithms.
- Scalability considerations involve managing a growing number of users and active sessions efficiently.
- Optimization strategies include using datetime for session expiration and efficient data structures for user and session management.

### 💻 Code Implementation Details
**Function/Class Documentation:**
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes the input password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with unique username and hashed password.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates the user and generates a session token.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends the user session based on the
