# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized with two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python. These files handle user input validation and authentication processes respectively.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions to validate user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
   
2. `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication logic within the system.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
- Use the functions defined in `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing authentication.
- Implement the authentication logic defined in `auth.py` to manage user login, registration, and authentication processes within the project.
