# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This folder is responsible for handling user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The `user_authentication` folder consists of two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters that contains functions for validating user input data.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters that handles user authentication logic.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- Role: Responsible for validating user input data.
- Size: 1212 characters
- Language: JavaScript

### auth.py
- Role: Manages user authentication processes.
- Size: 2198 characters
- Language: Python

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions provided in `validator.js`, import the necessary functions into your JavaScript files.
2. Use the functions in `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing it further.
3. In Python scripts, import `auth.py` to access the user authentication logic.
4. Implement the authentication processes defined in `auth.py` to authenticate users within the project.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets certain criteria (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username meets certain criteria (3-20 characters, alphanumeric and underscores only).
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of the input password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** This file can be imported into other JavaScript files using `require` or `import` statements to perform input validation for user authentication.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user authentication operations.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Method to register a new user.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Method to authenticate a user and return a session token.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Method to end a user session.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Method to check if a session is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class and use its methods for user registration, login, logout, and session validation.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib` for password hashing.
- `json` for JSON serialization.
- `datetime` for handling date and time.
- `timedelta` for time calculations.
- `typing` for type hints.
