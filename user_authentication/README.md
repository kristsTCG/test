# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This module is responsible for validating user input and managing user authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Language: JavaScript
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Role: Responsible for validating user input data to ensure it meets the required criteria for authentication.

2. **auth.py**
   - Language: Python
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Role: Manages the authentication process, including user login, registration, and token generation.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided by the `user_authentication` module, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation criteria for user input.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to implement user authentication processes such as login, registration, and token generation.
3. Integrate the necessary functions from these files into your project to enable user authentication features.

Remember to handle sensitive user data securely and follow best practices for authentication and data protection.
