# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks. It contains two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
- `auth.py`: This Python file handles the authentication logic for users. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the system.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review `validator.js` to understand the validation rules and functions.
2. Explore `auth.py` to understand the authentication flow and logic implemented.
3. Modify or extend the code as needed to fit the project's specific authentication requirements.
4. Ensure to maintain the integrity of user authentication processes while making changes.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length and character requirements.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username allowing alphanumeric characters and underscores only.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character complexity.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class where needed and call the respective validation functions or password strength function.

**Dependencies:** None

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user authentication operations.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** To use this file, create an instance of the `UserAuth` class and call its methods for user registration, login, logout, and session validation.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
