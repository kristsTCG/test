# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` for client-side input validation in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication logic in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It helps ensure that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submission.
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is responsible for server-side authentication processes. It manages user authentication, login, and session handling within the application.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules in this file to suit the project's requirements.
   - Include this script in your HTML files to enable client-side validation.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Implement additional authentication logic as needed in this Python file.
   - Integrate the authentication functionality with other parts of the project that require user authentication.

Ensure that both files work together seamlessly to provide a secure and user-friendly authentication experience for the application.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validation of email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** This file can be imported into other JavaScript files using `require` or `import` statements to perform input validation for user authentication processes.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
  - `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
  - `logout`: Method to end a user session.
  - `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
