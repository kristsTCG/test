# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This module is responsible for validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate different aspects of user authentication. The key components include a JavaScript file for validation (`validator.js`) and a Python file for authentication (`auth.py`).

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input such as email addresses, passwords, and other form data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring the integrity of user-provided information.
- `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` handles the authentication process, including user login, registration, and session management. It interacts with the database to verify user credentials and authorize access.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the necessary functions into your JavaScript files using `import { functionName } from './validator.js'`.
2. Use the validation functions provided in `validator.js` to validate user input before processing or storing it.
3. In Python scripts or modules, import `auth.py` using `import auth` to access authentication functionalities such as user login and registration.
4. Ensure that the authentication process is properly integrated with the rest of the project to secure user data and restrict unauthorized access.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character requirements.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class in your code:
```javascript
const InputValidator = require('./validator.js');
```
Then, you can call the validation functions like `InputValidator.validateEmail(email)` or `InputValidator.getPasswordStrength(password)`.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Register a new user with username, email, and password.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticate user and return a session token.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: End a user session.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to manage user authentication operations. Call `register_user` to register a new user, `login` to authenticate and get a session token, `logout` to end a session, and `is_authenticated` to check session validity.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: for hashing passwords.
- `json`: for JSON operations.
- `datetime`: for date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: for time calculations.
- `typing`: for type hints.
