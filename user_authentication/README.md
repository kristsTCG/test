- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters responsible for validating user input.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Role**: Responsible for validating user input.
- **Character Count**: 1212
- **Language**: JavaScript

### auth.py
- **Role**: Manages user authentication processes.
- **Character Count**: 2198
- **Language**: Python

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality, refer to `validator.js` and integrate the validation logic into your application where necessary.
