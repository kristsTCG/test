# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains JavaScript code (1212 characters) responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that user-provided information meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python file (2198 characters) manages the authentication logic for users. It handles tasks such as user login, registration, and authentication verification.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - To use the validation functions provided in `validator.js`, import the necessary functions into your JavaScript files using `import` or `require` statements.
   - Call the appropriate validation functions on user input data to ensure it meets the required criteria.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Utilize the functions defined in `auth.py` to handle user authentication tasks within your Python application.
   - Import the necessary functions from `auth.py` into your Python scripts to perform user login, registration, and authentication verification.

Ensure to follow the documentation within each file for specific usage instructions and function details.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on various criteria.

**Usage:** This file can be imported into other JavaScript files using `require` or `import` statements.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session using their session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and still active.

**Usage:** Import the `UserAuth` class from this file to handle user authentication in your Python application.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: Used for hashing passwords.
- `json`: Not used in this file but imported.
- `datetime`: Used for handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: Used for calculating expiration time for session tokens.
- `typing`: Used for type hints in function definitions.
