# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` for client-side input validation written in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication logic written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This file contains client-side validation logic to ensure that user input meets specified criteria before submission.
- `auth.py`: This file implements server-side authentication functionality, handling user login, registration, and authentication processes.

## Usage
1. Use `validator.js` to include client-side validation in your web application by importing or linking the script in your HTML file.
2. Utilize `auth.py` to implement server-side authentication logic in your Python backend. Customize the authentication process as needed for your project requirements.
