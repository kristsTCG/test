# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It includes files for validating user input and handling user authentication using JavaScript and Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication processes efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` and `auth.py`, which are responsible for validating user input and managing user authentication, respectively.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is crucial for validating user input data. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.

2. `auth.py`: This Python file is 2198 characters long and plays a significant role in handling user authentication within the project. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes securely.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
- Review `validator.js` to understand the validation criteria for user input data.
- Explore `auth.py` to grasp how user authentication processes are managed within the project.
- Make necessary modifications or enhancements to these files based on project requirements.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file contains input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and a number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is between 3-20 characters long and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of the input password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** To use this file, import it into your project using `require` or `import` statements. For example:
```javascript
const InputValidator = require('./validator.js');

if (InputValidator.validateEmail('example@email.com')) {
    console.log('Email is valid');
}
```

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies are required for this file.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session management.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
