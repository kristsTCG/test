# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input data related to authentication processes. It plays a crucial role in ensuring the security and integrity of user information.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file, 2198 characters in length, handles the actual authentication logic for users. It manages user login, registration, and other authentication-related tasks within the project.

## Usage
Developers can utilize the `validator.js` file to implement robust input validation for user authentication forms. The `auth.py` file can be used to integrate user authentication features into the project, such as user registration and login functionalities. Ensure to follow the code structure and guidelines within these files for seamless integration and secure user authentication processes.
