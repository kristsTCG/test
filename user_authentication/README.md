# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` for client-side input validation written in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication logic written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic to ensure that user input meets specified criteria before submission. It plays a crucial role in enhancing data integrity and security.
   
2. **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is responsible for server-side authentication processes. It manages user authentication, including login, registration, and session management. This file is essential for securing user accounts and controlling access to protected resources.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
- Use `validator.js` to implement client-side validation for user input forms.
- Incorporate `auth.py` to handle user authentication processes on the server-side.
- Ensure that both files are integrated seamlessly with other components of the project to maintain a secure and user-friendly authentication system.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class managing user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to utilize user authentication functionalities.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For representing time intervals.
- `typing`: For type hints.
