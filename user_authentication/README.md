## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: Responsible for validating user input data.
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Language: JavaScript

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Manages user authentication processes.
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Language: Python

## Usage
1. **validator.js**
   - To use the `validator.js` file, import it into your JavaScript code using `require` or `import` statements.
   - Utilize the functions within `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing it further.

2. **auth.py**
   - Incorporate `auth.py` into your Python project by importing it using `import auth`.
   - Use the functions provided in `auth.py` to handle user authentication tasks such as login, logout, and user session management.

Ensure to follow the documentation within each file for detailed instructions on how to interact with the code effectively.
