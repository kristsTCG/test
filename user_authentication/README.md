# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` contains two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters responsible for validating user input.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Purpose**: Validates user input data.
- **Character count**: 1212
- **Role**: Ensures that user-provided data meets specified criteria before further processing.

### auth.py
- **Purpose**: Manages user authentication processes.
- **Character count**: 2198
- **Role**: Handles user login, registration, and authentication within the system.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality, refer to `validator.js` and integrate the validation logic into your codebase.
2. For user authentication processes, utilize `auth.py` to handle user login, registration, and authentication within your project.

Ensure to follow the guidelines and functions defined within each file for seamless integration and functionality.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and a number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is 3-20 characters long and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** This file can be imported using `require` or `import` statements to access the input validation functionalities.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token if successful.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the session token.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations in your Python application.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization/deserialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
