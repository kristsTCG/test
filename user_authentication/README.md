# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` for client-side input validation written in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication logic written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic with 1212 characters. It ensures that user input meets specified criteria before submitting to the server for authentication.
   
2. **auth.py**: With 2198 characters, this Python file handles server-side authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication against the database.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionality provided in this folder:
- Use `validator.js` to implement client-side input validation in your web application.
- Integrate `auth.py` into your server-side codebase to manage user authentication processes securely.

Ensure to follow the documentation within each file for specific usage instructions and customization options.

- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username allowing alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength level of a password based on various criteria.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the provided validation methods in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
