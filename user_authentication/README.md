# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder consists of two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file containing functions for validating user input. (1212 characters)
- `auth.py`: A Python file handling user authentication processes. (2198 characters)

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file is crucial for ensuring that user input meets the required criteria. It contains functions for validating data such as email addresses, passwords, and other user information.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is responsible for managing user authentication within the project. It handles processes such as user login, registration, and authentication checks.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the necessary functions into your JavaScript files and call them as needed to validate user input.
2. For user authentication processes, import and utilize the functions provided in `auth.py` within your Python scripts to handle user login, registration, and authentication tasks.
