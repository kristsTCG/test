# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder consists of two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python. These files are responsible for validating user input and handling user authentication, respectively.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication functionalities within the project.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
- Review `validator.js` for validation functions and ensure that user input data is validated properly before proceeding with authentication processes.
- Utilize `auth.py` for user authentication tasks such as login, registration, and authentication within the project. Make necessary modifications or additions based on project requirements.
