## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input, ensuring data integrity and security.
- **auth.py**: This file handles user authentication processes, such as login, registration, and session management.

## Usage
Developers can utilize the `validator.js` file to implement input validation for user authentication forms. The `auth.py` file can be used to integrate user authentication features into the project, such as user registration and login functionality. Ensure to follow the documentation within each file for proper usage and integration with the project.
