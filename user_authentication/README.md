# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle validation and authentication processes for users.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate validation logic in `validator.js` (JavaScript) and authentication logic in `auth.py` (Python).

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**:
   - Role: Contains validation logic for user inputs.
   - Size: 1212 characters.
   
2. **auth.py**:
   - Role: Implements user authentication processes.
   - Size: 2198 characters.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed for user inputs.
   - Import and use the validation functions in other parts of the project where user input validation is required.
   
2. **auth.py**:
   - Implement additional authentication methods or customize existing ones.
   - Integrate the authentication logic with user management systems or user interfaces in the project.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username inputs, as well as determining the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username allowing alphanumeric characters and underscores within a specific length range.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** This file can be imported using `require` or `import` statements in other JavaScript files to utilize the input validation functions provided.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies and can be used independently for input validation tasks.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session by invalidating the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and not expired.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For handling JSON data.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
