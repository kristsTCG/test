# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` contains two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters, responsible for validating user input data.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters, handling user authentication logic.

## Key Files
### validator.js
The `validator.js` file is crucial for ensuring the validity of user input data. It contains functions to validate user information such as email addresses, passwords, and other input fields.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is responsible for managing user authentication within the project. It handles processes such as user login, registration, and authentication token generation.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided by the `user_authentication` folder, follow these steps:
1. Use the functions defined in `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing.
2. Incorporate the authentication logic from `auth.py` to manage user authentication processes within the project.
3. Ensure that both files are imported and utilized appropriately in the project's codebase to enable secure user authentication.
