# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input to ensure data integrity and security.
- **auth.py**: This file handles user authentication processes such as login, registration, and session management.

## Usage
1. To use the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the necessary functions into your JavaScript files and call them with the appropriate parameters.
2. For user authentication tasks, utilize the functions provided in `auth.py` by importing them into your Python scripts and invoking them as needed.
3. Ensure to handle errors and exceptions properly when working with the authentication functionalities to maintain security and reliability.
