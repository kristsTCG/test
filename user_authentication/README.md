# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files, `validator.js` and `auth.py`, which are responsible for validating user input and handling authentication logic, respectively.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is crucial for validating user input data. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file, with 2198 characters, manages the authentication logic for users. It handles tasks such as user login, registration, and authentication verification.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in the `user_authentication` folder, follow these steps:
1. Use the `validator.js` file to validate user input data before processing authentication.
2. Utilize the `auth.py` file to implement user authentication processes such as login, registration, and verification.

Ensure that you integrate these files seamlessly into your project to enhance user authentication security and reliability.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and a number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is between 3-20 characters long and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of the input password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py
