# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This module is responsible for validating user input and handling user authentication processes.

## Structure
The `user_authentication` folder contains two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters, responsible for validating user input data.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters, responsible for handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
The `validator.js` file is crucial for ensuring that user input data is validated before being processed. It contains functions to validate user input such as email addresses, passwords, and other user-related data.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is essential for managing user authentication processes within the project. It handles tasks such as user login, registration, password reset, and authentication token generation.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules applied to user input data.
2. Utilize the functions in `auth.py` for implementing user authentication features in the project.
3. Ensure that the authentication logic aligns with the project's security requirements and best practices.

- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username, allowing alphanumeric characters and underscores within a specific length range.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types, returning a descriptive level.

**Usage:** This file can be imported as a module to perform input validation for user authentication processes.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
