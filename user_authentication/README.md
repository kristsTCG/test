# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This functionality is crucial for managing user access and security.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side validation in JavaScript and auth.py for server-side authentication in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It plays a key role in ensuring that user data is correctly formatted before submission.
- **auth.py**: This Python file manages server-side authentication processes. It handles user login, registration, and authentication to grant access to authorized users.

## Usage
1. To utilize the client-side validation logic, refer to `validator.js` and integrate it into your front-end code to validate user input before submitting forms.
2. For server-side authentication functionalities, utilize `auth.py` to handle user authentication processes such as login, registration, and authorization checks. Ensure proper integration with your backend system for secure user authentication.
