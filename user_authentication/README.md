## Key Files
1. **validator.js**:
   - Language: JavaScript
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Role: This file is responsible for validating user input and ensuring data integrity during the authentication process.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Language: Python
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Role: This file manages the authentication logic, including user login, registration, and session management.

## Usage
1. To utilize the functionalities provided by `validator.js`, import the module into your JavaScript files using `require` or `import` statements. Use the exported functions to validate user input data.

2. In Python scripts, import the `auth.py` module to access the authentication features. Implement the provided functions to handle user login, registration, and session management within your application.

Ensure to follow the documentation and code comments within the files for a better understanding of their usage and integration within the project.
