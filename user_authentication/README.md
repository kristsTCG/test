# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` for client-side validation written in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: Handles client-side validation for user input.
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Language: JavaScript

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Manages server-side authentication processes.
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Language: Python

## Usage
1. **validator.js**
   - Modify the validation rules as needed for user input fields.
   - Integrate the validation functions with the frontend forms to ensure data integrity.

2. **auth.py**
   - Configure authentication methods such as login, logout, and user registration.
   - Implement security measures to protect user credentials and sensitive data.
   - Integrate authentication logic with the backend services to control user access.

Ensure proper coordination between client-side validation and server-side authentication to provide a seamless and secure user authentication experience.
