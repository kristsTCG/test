# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized with two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file containing functions for validating user input. (1212 characters)
- `auth.py`: A Python file implementing authentication logic for user login and access control. (2198 characters)

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file is crucial for ensuring that user input meets specified criteria before processing. It contains functions for validating data such as email addresses, passwords, and other user input.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is responsible for handling user authentication processes, including login functionality, user session management, and access control. It plays a vital role in securing user accounts and controlling user access within the application.

## Usage
Developers can utilize the `validator.js` functions to validate user input before processing it further. This helps maintain data integrity and security within the application. The `auth.py` file provides the necessary authentication logic for user login and access control, which can be integrated into the project's user management system. Ensure to follow the documentation within each file for proper implementation and usage.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of being at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and a number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is 3-20 characters long and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on its length and character composition.

**Usage:** This file can be imported using `require` or `import` statements in other JavaScript files to perform input validation for user authentication.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash passwords using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For handling JSON data.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
