# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It includes validation logic in JavaScript and authentication logic in Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks. The key components include a JavaScript file for data validation (`validator.js`) and a Python file for user authentication (`auth.py`).

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains logic for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
- `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication tasks within the project.

## Usage
Developers can utilize the `validator.js` file to implement data validation for user inputs in the authentication process. The `auth.py` file can be used to integrate user authentication functionalities into the project, such as user registration and login processes. Ensure to follow the code structure and logic defined in these files for seamless user authentication operations.
