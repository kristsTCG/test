# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` is organized with the following key components:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file containing functions for validating user input.
- `auth.py`: A Python file handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Role**: Responsible for validating user input.
- **Size**: 1212 characters
- **Usage**: Ensures that user-provided data meets specified criteria before processing.

### auth.py
- **Role**: Manages user authentication processes.
- **Size**: 2198 characters
- **Usage**: Handles user login, registration, and authentication operations.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code and call the appropriate validation functions as needed.
2. For user authentication processes, utilize the functions and methods defined in `auth.py` by importing the file into your Python code and invoking the necessary functions for user login, registration, and authentication.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**

- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets specific criteria (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username meets specific criteria (3-20 characters, alphanumeric and underscores only).
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of the input password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** User authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to access user authentication functionalities like registration, login, logout, and session validation.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
