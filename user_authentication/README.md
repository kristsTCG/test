# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This functionality is responsible for validating user input and handling user authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate the validation logic implemented in JavaScript and the authentication logic implemented in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains the validation logic for user input. It is crucial for ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
- `auth.py`: This Python file contains the authentication logic for verifying user credentials and managing user sessions. It plays a key role in securely authenticating users within the system.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation logic, refer to `validator.js` and integrate the necessary validation functions into your user input forms.
2. For user authentication processes, interact with `auth.py` to authenticate users based on their credentials and manage user sessions securely.

Ensure that both files are appropriately integrated into the project's authentication workflow to maintain a secure and reliable user authentication system.

- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on various criteria.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in other parts of the application.

**Dependencies:** None

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
