# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes validation logic in JavaScript and authentication logic in Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` for input validation and `auth.py` for user authentication.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains logic for validating user inputs. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
- `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` handles user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication tasks within the application.

## Usage
To utilize the code in this folder:
1. Use `validator.js` to validate user inputs before processing authentication requests.
2. Implement the functions in `auth.py` to manage user authentication tasks such as login, registration, and authentication within the project.
