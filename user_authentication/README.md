# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side validation and auth.py for server-side authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It ensures that user data meets specified criteria before submitting it for authentication.
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for server-side authentication. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes securely.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to suit the project requirements.
   - Include `validator.js` in your HTML files using `<script>` tags to enable client-side validation.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Implement additional authentication features such as two-factor authentication or password hashing.
   - Integrate `auth.py` with your backend server to handle user authentication requests effectively.
