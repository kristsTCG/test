# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for authentication logic.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input, ensuring data integrity and security.
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file handles user authentication processes, such as login, logout, and session management.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code and call the appropriate validation functions as needed.
2. For user authentication tasks, import `auth.py` into your Python code and utilize the provided authentication methods for secure user login and session management.
