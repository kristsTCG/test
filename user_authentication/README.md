## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.

2. **auth.py**: This Python file consists of 2198 characters and manages the authentication logic for users. It handles user login, registration, and authentication processes within the system.

## Usage
Developers can utilize the `validator.js` and `auth.py` files to implement user authentication features in their projects. To integrate these functionalities, import the necessary functions from these files and use them as needed in the authentication flow. Ensure to follow the documentation and guidelines provided within each file for seamless integration.
