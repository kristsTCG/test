# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: Responsible for validating user input.
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Language: JavaScript

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Contains authentication logic for user verification.
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Language: Python

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality, refer to `validator.js`. This file contains functions for validating user input such as email addresses, passwords, etc. You can integrate these functions into your user registration or login forms.

2. For authentication tasks, refer to `auth.py`. This file handles the authentication logic, including verifying user credentials and granting access to authorized users. You can extend this file to include additional security measures or user management features.

Ensure to maintain the integrity of the authentication process and handle user data securely to prevent unauthorized access.
