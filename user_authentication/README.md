# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It includes a JavaScript file for validation and a Python file for handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files, `validator.js` for client-side validation and `auth.py` for server-side authentication.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation logic for user inputs. It plays a crucial role in ensuring data integrity before submitting it to the server.
   
2. **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for server-side authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication against the database.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to suit the project requirements.
   - Include the `validator.js` file in your HTML pages using the `<script>` tag.
   - Call the validation functions from your form submission handlers to validate user inputs.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Configure database connections and user authentication logic within the `auth.py` file.
   - Import and use the necessary functions from `auth.py` in your server-side code to manage user authentication processes.

Ensure to maintain the integrity and security of user authentication processes by following best practices and regularly updating the validation and authentication logic in these files.
