- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters, responsible for input validation.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters, handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Role**: Handles input validation for user authentication.
- **Character Count**: 1212
- **Usage**: Ensures that user input meets specified criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.

### auth.py
- **Role**: Manages user authentication procedures.
- **Character Count**: 2198
- **Usage**: Implements authentication logic, such as verifying user credentials and generating authentication tokens.

## Usage
1. To utilize the input validation functionality provided by `validator.js`, import the module into your JavaScript files:
   ```javascript
   const validator = require('./validator.js');
   ```
   Use the exported functions from `validator.js` to validate user input before authentication.

2. For user authentication procedures, import `auth.py` into your Python scripts:
   ```python
   import auth
   ```
   Utilize the functions defined in `auth.py` to authenticate users and manage authentication tokens.

3. Ensure to follow the specific usage guidelines documented within each file for seamless integration with the user authentication module.
