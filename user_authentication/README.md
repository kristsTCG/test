# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
- `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` implements the authentication logic for verifying user credentials and managing user sessions.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules applied to user input.
2. Examine the `auth.py` file to understand how user authentication is implemented in the project.
3. Integrate these files into your project as needed to handle user authentication processes effectively.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates a password based on specific criteria (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates a username for length (3-20 characters) and allowed characters (alphanumeric and underscores).
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the provided session token.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to perform user registration, login, logout, and authentication operations.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For handling JSON data.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
