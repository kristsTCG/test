# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes to ensure secure access to the system.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication features efficiently. It includes two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python, which collectively handle user validation and authentication logic.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input data to ensure it meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python file, with 2198 characters, manages the authentication process for users, verifying their identity and granting access to the system based on the provided credentials.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication features in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules for user input data.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to grasp the authentication logic and processes implemented for user access control.
3. Integrate these files into the project's authentication flow as needed, ensuring secure user authentication mechanisms are in place.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class in your code and call the respective validation functions as needed.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token for active sessions.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by invalidating the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For handling JSON data.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hinting in Python.
