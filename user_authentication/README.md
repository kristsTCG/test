# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication logic within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules and functions available for user input.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to understand the authentication logic and processes implemented for user registration and login.
3. Use the functions and classes defined in these files within your project to enable secure user authentication mechanisms.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input is a valid email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and a number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is 3-20 characters long and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types, returning a strength level.

**Usage:** This file can be imported as a module to perform input validation in user authentication processes.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token for active sessions.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by removing the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize user authentication functionalities like registration, login, logout, and session validation.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in the provided code snippet).
- `datetime`: For handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
