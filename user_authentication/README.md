# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that the data provided by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
  
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is responsible for handling user authentication logic using Python. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the application.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules and functions available for user input.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to grasp the user authentication logic implemented in Python.
3. Integrate these files into your project to enhance user authentication and data validation processes.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the specified criteria (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username meets the specified criteria (3-20 characters, alphanumeric and underscores only).
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of the input password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class where input validation is needed.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the provided session token.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For date and time operations.
- `timedelta` from `datetime`: For calculating session expiration time.
- `typing.Optional`, `typing.Dict`: For type hinting.
