# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input, ensuring that the data entered by users meets specified criteria. It plays a crucial role in maintaining data integrity and security.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python file is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It includes functions for user login, registration, and authentication. It manages user sessions and access control within the application.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Import the `validator.js` file into your JavaScript code.
   - Utilize the validation functions provided within this file to validate user input such as email addresses, passwords, and other form data.
   - Customize the validation criteria as needed for your project requirements.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Import the `auth.py` file into your Python codebase.
   - Use the functions within `auth.py` to implement user authentication features like user registration, login, and session management.
   - Ensure to integrate these authentication functionalities with your application's user interface and backend logic for a seamless user experience.

Remember to handle errors and edge cases appropriately when working with user authentication functionalities to enhance the security and usability of your application.
