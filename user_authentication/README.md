# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes validation logic in JavaScript and authentication logic in Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication processes. It contains two key files, `validator.js` for input validation and `auth.py` for user authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains logic for validating user inputs. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication within the system.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - To use the validation logic in `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code.
   - Utilize the provided functions to validate user inputs such as email addresses, passwords, etc.
   - Customize the validation rules as per the project requirements.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Import `auth.py` into your Python code to access the authentication functionalities.
   - Use the provided functions to handle user registration, login, and authentication processes.
   - Ensure to integrate the authentication logic seamlessly with the rest of the project's codebase.

By following the guidelines outlined in the documentation, developers can effectively leverage the user authentication features provided in the `user_authentication` folder.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.

- `logout`: Method to end a user session by invalidating the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication within your application.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
