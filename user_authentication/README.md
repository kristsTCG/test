# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes a JavaScript file for validation logic and a Python file for authentication operations.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` for client-side validation and `auth.py` for server-side authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation logic for user input data. It ensures that user inputs meet specified criteria before submission.
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` handles server-side authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication operations.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules in `validator.js` to suit the project's requirements.
   - Include `validator.js` in your HTML files using `<script src="path/to/validator.js"></script>`.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Implement the necessary authentication logic in `auth.py` such as user login, registration, and password hashing.
   - Integrate `auth.py` with your server-side code to handle user authentication processes.

Ensure to maintain the integrity of the authentication process and follow best practices for user security.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username (alphanumeric and underscores only).
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use its validation methods in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** User authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For working with JSON data.
- `datetime`: For handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
