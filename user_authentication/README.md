# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It includes validation logic in JavaScript and authentication logic in Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks. It contains two key files, `validator.js` for input validation and `auth.py` for user authentication.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains logic for validating user inputs. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.

2. `auth.py`: This Python file handles user authentication processes. It includes functions for verifying user credentials, generating tokens, and managing user sessions.

## Usage
1. To utilize the input validation functionality, refer to `validator.js` and integrate the validation logic into your frontend forms or backend API endpoints.

2. For user authentication tasks, utilize the functions provided in `auth.py` to authenticate users, manage sessions, and handle token generation and verification.

3. Ensure to maintain the integrity of the authentication process and follow best practices to secure user data and prevent unauthorized access.

- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username allowing alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password and returns a descriptive level.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class in your code and call the validation methods as needed.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file provides a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and hashed password.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token if successful.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the provided session token.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Import the `UserAuth` class from this file to handle user authentication in your application.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
