## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication features. It includes validator.js for client-side validation written in JavaScript and auth.py for server-side authentication written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It ensures that user-provided data meets specified criteria before submission.
- **auth.py**: The auth.py file handles server-side authentication processes. It verifies user credentials and manages user sessions securely.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to match the project requirements.
   - Include the validator.js file in your HTML pages using `<script>` tags to enable client-side validation.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Implement additional authentication logic as required by the project.
   - Integrate auth.py with your server-side code to authenticate users during login and access control processes.
