# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It includes validation logic in JavaScript and authentication logic in Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` for input validation and `auth.py` for user authentication.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains logic for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication tasks within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the code in this folder:
- Use `validator.js` for validating user input data before processing authentication requests.
- Incorporate `auth.py` to manage user authentication functionalities such as login, registration, and authentication processes.
