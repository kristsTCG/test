# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python file handles the authentication logic for users. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the system.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions provided in `validator.js`, import the necessary functions into your JavaScript files and call them as needed to validate user input data.

2. For user authentication functionalities, interact with the `auth.py` file in Python. Use the exposed methods to handle user registration, login, and authentication processes within your application.

3. Ensure that you understand the specific functions and methods available in each file to effectively implement user authentication features in your project.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the format of a password (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username (3-20 characters, alphanumeric and underscores only).
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** This file can be imported into other JavaScript files using `require` or `import` statements, and the functions can be called as static methods of the `InputValidator` class.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
