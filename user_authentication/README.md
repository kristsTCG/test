# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` contains two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters, responsible for validating user input.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters, handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file is crucial for ensuring that user input is validated before proceeding with any authentication processes. It plays a key role in maintaining data integrity and security within the application.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is responsible for handling user authentication processes, such as login, registration, and session management. It is a critical component in ensuring secure access to the application.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review `validator.js` for any custom validation rules or modifications needed for user input validation.
2. Understand the logic and functions within `auth.py` to customize authentication processes according to project requirements.
3. Ensure proper integration of these files with other components of the project that require user authentication functionalities.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations like registration, login, and session handling.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization and deserialization.
