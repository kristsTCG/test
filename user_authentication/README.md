The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This module is responsible for validating user input and handling user authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` consists of two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters, responsible for validating user input data.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters, responsible for handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file contains functions for validating user input data to ensure data integrity and security. It plays a crucial role in preventing malicious input and maintaining the quality of user data.

### auth.py
This file is responsible for managing user authentication processes, such as login, registration, and password management. It handles user authentication securely and efficiently.

## Usage
1. To use the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code and call the appropriate validation functions with the user input data as parameters.
2. To utilize the user authentication functionalities in `auth.py`, import the file into your Python code and use the provided functions for user login, registration, and password management.

Ensure that you follow best practices for user authentication and data validation when working with the code in this folder.
