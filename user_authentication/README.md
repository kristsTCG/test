# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input data related to authentication processes.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file is 2198 characters long and contains authentication logic for verifying user credentials and managing user sessions.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules applied to user input data.
2. Examine the `auth.py` file to understand how user authentication is implemented in the project.
3. Modify the files as needed to customize authentication behavior or add new features.
4. Ensure that any changes made adhere to security best practices to protect user data.
