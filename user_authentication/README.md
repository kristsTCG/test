# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
- **auth.py**: This Python file handles the authentication logic for users. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes.

## Usage
To utilize the functionality provided in this folder:
1. Review the code in `validator.js` to understand the validation rules applied to user input.
2. Explore `auth.py` to understand how user authentication is handled within the project.
3. Modify or extend the code as needed to fit the specific requirements of the project.
4. Ensure that the functions in `validator.js` are integrated into the authentication flow in `auth.py` for a seamless user authentication experience.

- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character requirements.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the provided validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password()`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user()`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login()`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout()`: Method to end a user session based on the session token.
- `is_authenticated()`: Method to check if a session token is valid and the user is authenticated.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: Required for hashing passwords.
- `json`: Not used in the provided code but imported.
- `datetime`: Used for handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: Used for calculating session expiration time.
- `typing`: Used for type hinting.
