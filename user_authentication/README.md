# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria for authentication.

2. **auth.py**: This Python file consists of 2198 characters and handles the authentication logic for users. It verifies user credentials and grants access based on the authentication process.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionality in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules for user input data.
2. Examine the `auth.py` file to understand the authentication process and how user credentials are verified.
3. Integrate these files into your project's authentication system as needed.
4. Ensure to handle errors and exceptions that may arise during the authentication process.
