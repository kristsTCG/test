# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side validation and auth.py for server-side authentication logic.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submission.
- **auth.py**: The Python file auth.py handles server-side authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication to ensure secure access to the application.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to match the project requirements.
   - Include the validator.js file in your HTML pages using `<script src="path/to/validator.js"></script>`.
   - Call the validation functions from your form submission logic to validate user input.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Integrate the auth.py file with your backend application.
   - Utilize the provided authentication functions for user registration, login, and session management.
   - Ensure proper error handling and security measures are in place to protect user data.

By following the guidelines outlined in the key files, developers can effectively implement user authentication features in their project using the code provided in this folder.
