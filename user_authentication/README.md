# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes scripts for validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains JavaScript code (1212 characters) responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the data entered by the user meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python script (2198 characters) manages the authentication process for users. It handles user login, registration, and authentication tasks within the system.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to suit the project's requirements.
   - Include this script in the appropriate modules where user input validation is necessary.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Implement additional authentication logic or customize the existing functionality.
   - Integrate this script with other parts of the system that require user authentication.

Ensure to maintain the integrity of the authentication process and follow best practices for user data security.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file contains input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username allowing only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates and returns the strength level of a password.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication process.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user authentication operations.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token for active sessions.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by removing the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Import the `UserAuth` class from this file to handle user authentication in your application.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib` for hashing functions.
- `json` for JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime` and `timedelta` from `datetime` module for date and time operations.
- `Optional` and `Dict` from `typing` module for type hints.
