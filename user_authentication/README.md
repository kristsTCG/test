# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- Role: Responsible for validating user input data.
- Size: 1212 characters
- Language: JavaScript

### auth.py
- Role: Manages user authentication processes.
- Size: 2198 characters
- Language: Python

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality, refer to `validator.js` for implementing validation logic in JavaScript.
2. For user authentication tasks, utilize `auth.py` to manage authentication processes in Python.
3. Ensure to integrate these files into the project's authentication flow for secure user interactions.
