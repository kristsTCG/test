# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes files responsible for validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python, each serving a specific purpose in the authentication process.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file consists of 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input related to authentication. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- `auth.py`: This Python file, with 2198 characters, handles the authentication logic for users. It manages the process of verifying user credentials and granting access to authenticated users.

## Usage
To utilize the code in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules for user input.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to comprehend the authentication process and how user credentials are verified.
3. Integrate these files into the project's authentication system as needed, ensuring proper error handling and security measures are in place.
