# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes a JavaScript file for validation logic and a Python file for handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to centralize all user authentication-related code. It currently consists of two key files: `validator.js` and `auth.py`.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: Contains JavaScript code for validating user input data.
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Usage: Ensures that user-provided data meets specified criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Implements user authentication logic using Python.
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Usage: Handles user login, registration, and authentication processes within the project.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality, refer to `validator.js` and incorporate the validation logic into your user input forms or data processing scripts.
   
2. For user authentication tasks, interact with `auth.py` to manage user login, registration, and authentication processes. Ensure to integrate this file with other project components that require user authentication functionalities.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file contains input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username inputs, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** This file can be imported into other JavaScript files using `require` or `import` statements to perform input validation for user authentication.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
- `hash_password()`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user()`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login()`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout()`: Method to end a user session using the session token.
- `is_authenticated()`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to use the authentication system. Call `register_user()` to add a new user, `login()` to authenticate and get a session token, `logout()` to end a session, and `is_authenticated()` to check session validity.

**Dependencies:** `hashlib`, `json`, `datetime`, `timedelta`, `typing`.
