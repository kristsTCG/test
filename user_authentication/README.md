# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This functionality is crucial for managing user access and security.

## Structure
The folder is organized with two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters that likely handles client-side validation for user input.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters that likely implements server-side authentication logic.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file is responsible for validating user input on the client-side, ensuring that data entered by users meets specified criteria before being submitted to the server.

### auth.py
This file contains the server-side authentication logic, handling tasks such as verifying user credentials, generating tokens, and managing user sessions.

## Usage
Developers working with the `user_authentication` functionality should:
1. Review and potentially modify the validation rules in `validator.js` to suit the project's requirements.
2. Understand and potentially extend the authentication logic in `auth.py` to accommodate additional security features or integration with other systems.

It is important to ensure that any changes made to these files do not compromise the security and integrity of the user authentication process. Testing thoroughly after modifications is recommended to validate the changes made.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is between 3-20 characters and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, logout, and session authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session by invalidating the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and not expired.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations. Call methods like `register_user`, `login`, `logout`, and `is_authenticated` as needed.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON operations.
- `datetime`: For handling date and time.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
