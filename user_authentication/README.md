# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**:
   - Role: Responsible for validating user input data.
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Language: JavaScript

2. **auth.py**:
   - Role: Handles user authentication logic.
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Language: Python

## Usage
1. To use the validation functionality, refer to `validator.js`. This file contains functions to validate user input data. You can import and use these functions in your code to ensure data integrity.

2. For user authentication tasks, refer to `auth.py`. This file contains the logic for authenticating users. You can integrate this file into your project to handle user login, registration, and authentication processes.
