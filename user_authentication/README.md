# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It ensures that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submission.
  
- **auth.py**: This file contains server-side authentication logic written in Python. It handles user authentication processes such as login, registration, and password management.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to match the project's requirements.
   - Include the script in the frontend code to validate user input before submitting forms.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Implement additional authentication features as required by the project.
   - Integrate the authentication logic with the backend system to secure user data and access.

Ensure that both files work together seamlessly to provide a robust user authentication system in the project.

- `logout`: Method to end a user's session based on the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and the user is authenticated.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For handling JSON data.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
