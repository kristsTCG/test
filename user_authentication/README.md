# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` for client-side input validation in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication logic in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic written in JavaScript. It ensures that user input meets specified criteria before submission.
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file contains server-side authentication functionality written in Python. It manages user authentication processes such as login, registration, and authentication checks.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to suit the project requirements.
   - Include the `validator.js` file in your HTML pages using the `<script>` tag.
   - Call the validation functions from your form submission logic to validate user input.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Implement additional authentication features as required by extending the existing logic.
   - Integrate the `auth.py` file with your backend server code to handle user authentication processes.
   - Ensure proper error handling and security measures are in place to protect user data.

By following the guidelines above, you can effectively utilize the user authentication functionality provided in the `user_authentication` folder.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is between 3-20 characters and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of the input password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file provides a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and generates a session token for active sessions.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session by removing the session token from active sessions.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid and not expired.

**Usage:** To use this file, create an instance of `UserAuth` and call its methods for user registration, login, logout, and authentication.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For handling JSON data.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
