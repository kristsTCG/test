# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes a JavaScript file for validation (`validator.js`) and a Python file for authentication (`auth.py`).

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input, ensuring data integrity and security.
- `auth.py`: The Python file handles user authentication processes, such as login, registration, and password management.

## Usage
Developers can utilize the `validator.js` file to implement client-side input validation for user registration and login forms. The `auth.py` file can be used to manage user authentication on the server-side, handling user login requests and verifying user credentials. Ensure to integrate these files into the project's authentication workflow for secure user interactions.
