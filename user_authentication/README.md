# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This functionality is crucial for managing user access and security.

## Structure
The folder contains two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters that likely handles client-side validation for user inputs related to authentication.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters that likely implements server-side authentication logic using Python.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file is responsible for validating user inputs on the client-side to ensure data integrity and security. It likely contains functions for validating email addresses, passwords, and other user credentials.

### auth.py
This file is crucial for handling user authentication on the server-side. It likely includes functions for user login, registration, password hashing, and token generation. The logic in this file ensures secure access control for users.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review `validator.js` to understand the client-side validation logic and customize it as needed.
2. Study `auth.py` to grasp the server-side authentication implementation and make any necessary adjustments for your project's requirements.
3. Ensure that the authentication flow between the client and server is secure and follows best practices to protect user data.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character requirements.

**Usage:** This file can be imported as a module in other JavaScript files to perform input validation for user authentication.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session using their session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and the user is authenticated.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations like registration, login, and session handling.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in the provided code).
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints (not used in the provided code).
