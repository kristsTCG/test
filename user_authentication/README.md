# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This functionality is responsible for validating user input and handling user authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate the validation logic implemented in JavaScript and the authentication logic implemented in Python. The key components include `validator.js` for input validation and `auth.py` for user authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains the logic for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that the data entered by users meets the required criteria.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python file handles user authentication processes such as login, registration, and authentication checks. It is essential for managing user access to the system securely.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality, refer to `validator.js` and incorporate the validation methods into your user input forms.
   
2. For user authentication tasks, interact with `auth.py` to implement login, registration, and authentication features within the project.
   
3. Ensure to maintain the integrity of the authentication processes and adhere to security best practices when working with user authentication functionalities.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file contains input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric and underscore characters.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on various criteria.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the session token.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: Used for hashing passwords.
- `json`: Used for JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: Used for working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: Used for representing a duration of time.
- `typing.Optional`: Used for type hints to indicate that a value can be `None`.
- `typing.Dict`: Used for type hints to indicate a dictionary type.
