# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python file handles the authentication logic for users. It manages processes such as user login, registration, and authorization within the system.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation functions as needed to adjust the criteria for user input validation.
   - Import and utilize these functions in other parts of the project where user input validation is required.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Implement additional authentication functionalities as per project requirements.
   - Integrate the authentication logic with other parts of the system that require user authentication.

Ensure to maintain the integrity and security of user authentication processes while working with the code in this folder.

- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on various criteria.

**Usage:** This file can be imported into other JavaScript files using `require` or `import` statements to access the input validation functions.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token for active sessions.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session by removing the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and not expired.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to use the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
