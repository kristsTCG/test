# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This functionality is crucial for managing user access and security within the application.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication processes efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side validation logic and auth.py for server-side authentication functionality.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation logic for user input related to authentication. It plays a key role in ensuring data integrity and security on the client side.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for server-side authentication processes. It handles user authentication, authorization, and related security features on the server side.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Modify `validator.js` to customize client-side validation rules as needed.
2. Update `auth.py` to enhance server-side authentication logic or integrate with external authentication services.
3. Ensure that both client-side and server-side authentication processes are in sync to maintain a secure user authentication flow.
