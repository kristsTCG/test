# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes validation logic in JavaScript and authentication logic in Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` for input validation and `auth.py` for user authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters of code responsible for validating user inputs. It ensures that the data entered by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` consists of 2198 characters of code dedicated to user authentication. It manages the authentication process, including verifying user credentials and granting access to authorized users.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
1. Review the code in `validator.js` to understand the input validation logic.
2. Explore the code in `auth.py` to grasp the user authentication process.
3. Integrate these files into your project to enhance user authentication mechanisms.
