# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder consists of two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters that handles input validation for user authentication.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters responsible for authentication processes such as login, registration, and user management.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file is crucial for ensuring that user input for authentication is valid and meets the required criteria. It plays a significant role in maintaining data integrity and security.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is essential for managing user authentication within the project. It handles user login, registration, and other authentication-related tasks. This file is central to the security and functionality of the user authentication system.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review `validator.js` to understand the input validation logic and criteria.
2. Explore `auth.py` to familiarize yourself with the authentication processes and user management functionalities.
3. Make necessary modifications or enhancements to suit the project's specific requirements.
4. Ensure that any changes made adhere to security best practices and do not compromise user data integrity.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class and call the desired validation methods as needed.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to manage user authentication operations. Call `register_user` to create a new user, `login` to authenticate a user and get a session token, `logout` to end a session, and `is_authenticated` to check session validity.

**Dependencies:** `hashlib`, `json`, `datetime`, `timedelta`, `typing`.
