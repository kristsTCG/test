# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains the logic for validating user inputs and ensuring data integrity. It plays a crucial role in verifying user information before authentication.
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is responsible for handling user authentication processes using Python. It manages user login, registration, and authentication functionalities.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation logic, refer to `validator.js` and integrate it with your user input forms to ensure data accuracy.
2. For user authentication tasks, utilize the functionalities provided in `auth.py` to manage user login, registration, and authentication processes effectively.
