# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes validation logic in JavaScript and authentication logic in Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` for input validation and `auth.py` for user authentication.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters of code responsible for validating user inputs. It ensures that user-provided data meets specified criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
  
- `auth.py`: This Python file comprises 2198 characters of code dedicated to user authentication. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionalities in this folder:
1. Review `validator.js` for input validation requirements and integrate it into your frontend codebase.
2. Explore `auth.py` to understand the user authentication logic and incorporate it into your backend system for secure user authentication processes.
