# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This file contains functions for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that the data entered by users meets the required criteria.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file handles the authentication logic for users. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Use the functions in `validator.js` to validate user input before processing it further.
2. Utilize the authentication logic in `auth.py` to manage user authentication tasks such as login and registration.

Ensure that you understand the functions and methods defined in these files to effectively implement user authentication in the project.
