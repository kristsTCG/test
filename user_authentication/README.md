# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for authentication logic.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This file contains code for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user data is correctly formatted and meets the required criteria.
- `auth.py`: This file handles the authentication logic for users. It is responsible for verifying user credentials and granting access to authorized users.

## Usage
1. To use the validation functionality, refer to `validator.js`. Customize the validation rules as needed for your project requirements.
2. For authentication tasks, utilize `auth.py`. Implement the necessary authentication methods and integrate them into your project's user management system.
