# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.

2. `auth.py`: This Python file is 2198 characters long and handles the authentication logic for users. It manages user login, registration, and other authentication-related tasks within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionality in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation criteria for user input.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to grasp the authentication logic and processes implemented in Python.
3. Integrate the functions and methods from these files into your project as needed for user authentication tasks.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username allowing only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character complexity.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class in your code and call the validation methods as needed.

```javascript
const InputValidator = require('./validator.js');

if (InputValidator.validateEmail('example@email.com')) {
    console.log('Email is valid');
}

if (InputValidator.validatePassword('StrongPassword123')) {
    console.log('Password is valid');
}

if (InputValidator.validateUsername('user_name123')) {
    console.log('Username is valid');
}

const passwordStrength = InputValidator.getPasswordStrength('SecurePass123');
console.log('Password strength:', passwordStrength);
```

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
  - `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
  - `logout`: Method to end a user session by invalidating the session token.
  - `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For handling JSON data.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
