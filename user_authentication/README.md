# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It is responsible for validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input related to authentication. It ensures that the user-provided data meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file contains 2198 characters and handles the authentication logic for users. It manages user sessions, login/logout functionalities, and authentication processes.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in the `user_authentication` folder:
1. Review the code in `validator.js` to understand the validation criteria for user input.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to understand the authentication logic and how user sessions are managed.
3. Integrate these files into your project to enable user authentication features securely.
