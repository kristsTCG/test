# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This file contains the JavaScript code for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is written in Python and focuses on the authentication logic for users. It handles the process of verifying user credentials and granting access based on authentication rules.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules applied to user input.
2. Examine the `auth.py` file to understand the authentication logic and how user credentials are verified.
3. Make necessary modifications to the validation rules or authentication logic as per project requirements.
4. Ensure that any changes made adhere to security best practices for user authentication.
