# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` for client-side input validation written in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication logic written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This file contains client-side validation logic to ensure that user input meets specified criteria. It plays a crucial role in enhancing user experience by providing real-time feedback on input errors.
   
2. `auth.py`: This file handles server-side authentication processes, such as user login, registration, and session management. It is responsible for verifying user credentials and ensuring secure access to protected resources.

## Usage
1. To utilize the client-side validation functionality, refer to `validator.js` and integrate the validation rules into your front-end forms. This will help improve data quality and prevent erroneous submissions.
   
2. For server-side authentication tasks, interact with `auth.py` to implement user authentication features. This includes handling user login requests, verifying credentials against a database, and managing user sessions securely.

Ensure to maintain the integrity of the authentication process and follow best practices to safeguard user data and privacy.

**Usage:** To use this file, create an instance of `UserAuth` and call its methods for user registration, login, logout, and session validation.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib` for hashing passwords.
- `json` for JSON serialization.
- `datetime` for handling dates and times.
- `timedelta` for calculating time differences.
- `typing` for type hints.
