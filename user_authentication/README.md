# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes validation logic in JavaScript and authentication logic in Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication processes. It includes two key files: `validator.js` for input validation and `auth.py` for user authentication.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains logic for validating user inputs, ensuring data integrity and security.
- `auth.py`: This Python file handles user authentication processes, such as login, logout, and session management.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation logic, refer to `validator.js` and integrate the validation functions into your frontend forms or backend API endpoints.
2. For user authentication functionalities, utilize `auth.py` to implement secure user login and session management in your application. Make sure to handle authentication errors and secure user data appropriately.
