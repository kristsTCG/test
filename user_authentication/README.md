# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It includes validation logic in JavaScript and authentication logic in Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks. It contains two key files: `validator.js` for input validation and `auth.py` for user authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains logic for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before further processing.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication within the project. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to suit the project's requirements.
   - Include `validator.js` in relevant parts of the project where user input validation is necessary.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Use the functions provided in `auth.py` for user authentication tasks.
   - Integrate the authentication logic into the project's user management system.

Ensure that both files are appropriately imported and utilized within the project for seamless user authentication functionality.
