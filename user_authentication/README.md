# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file consists of 2198 characters and focuses on handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication within the system.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided by the `user_authentication` folder, follow these steps:
1. Modify the `validator.js` file to customize the validation rules as per project requirements.
2. Use the functions defined in `auth.py` to implement user authentication features in the project.
3. Ensure to integrate these files with other relevant components of the system for seamless user authentication flow.
