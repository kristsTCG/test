# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` for client-side input validation in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication logic in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: Responsible for client-side input validation.
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Language: JavaScript

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Manages server-side authentication processes.
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Language: Python

## Usage
1. **validator.js**
   - Ensure the file is linked correctly in your HTML file.
   - Use the functions provided in `validator.js` to validate user input on the client side.

2. **auth.py**
   - Integrate the authentication logic into your server-side code.
   - Utilize the functions and classes defined in `auth.py` to authenticate users securely.

Remember to maintain the integrity of the authentication process and handle user data securely to prevent unauthorized access.
