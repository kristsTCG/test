# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` contains two key files: `validator.js` and `auth.py`. These files handle user input validation and user authentication logic, respectively.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input, ensuring that data entered by users meets specified criteria and is safe for processing.
- `auth.py`: This Python file implements the authentication logic for users, handling processes such as user login, registration, and authorization.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the necessary functions into your JavaScript files using `import { functionName } from './validator.js'`.
2. Use the imported validation functions in your code to validate user input before processing it further.
3. In Python scripts, import the `auth.py` module using `import auth`.
4. Utilize the functions provided in `auth.py` for user authentication processes such as user login, registration, and authorization within your Python code.
