# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder consists of two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters responsible for validating user input.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- Role: Responsible for validating user input.
- Size: 1212 characters
- Language: JavaScript

### auth.py
- Role: Handles user authentication processes.
- Size: 2198 characters
- Language: Python

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality, refer to the `validator.js` file and integrate the validation logic into your application's user input forms.
2. For user authentication processes, utilize the functions and methods defined in the `auth.py` file to authenticate users within the system.

Ensure to maintain the integrity of the authentication and validation processes to enhance the security of the application.
