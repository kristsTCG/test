## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user inputs. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user data is correctly formatted and meets the required criteria.
   
2. **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication tasks within the project.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
- Use the functions defined in `validator.js` to validate user inputs before processing.
- Utilize the functionalities provided in `auth.py` for user authentication tasks such as login, registration, and authentication processes.
