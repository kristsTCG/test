# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input data for authentication purposes.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python file contains 2198 characters and handles the authentication logic for users within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file for user input validation logic.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to understand the authentication process for users.
3. Integrate these files into your project to enable user authentication features.
