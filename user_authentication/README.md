## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` consists of two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters, responsible for input validation.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters, handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Role**: Responsible for input validation.
- **Character Count**: 1212
- **Usage**: Ensures that user input meets specified criteria before processing.

### auth.py
- **Role**: Handles user authentication processes.
- **Character Count**: 2198
- **Usage**: Manages user login, registration, and authentication tasks.

## Usage
To utilize the functionality provided by the `user_authentication` module, follow these steps:
1. Import the necessary functions from `validator.js` or `auth.py` into your project files.
2. Use the validation functions from `validator.js` to validate user input before processing.
3. Implement the authentication processes provided in `auth.py` for user login, registration, and authentication.

Ensure that you adhere to the guidelines and conventions set within the `user_authentication` module for seamless integration and functionality.
