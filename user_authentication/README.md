## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It includes functions for user login, registration, and authentication checks.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions, refer to `validator.js` and import the necessary functions into your JavaScript files.
2. For user authentication tasks, make use of the functions defined in `auth.py`. Ensure to follow the authentication flow as per the functions provided in the file.
3. Maintain the integrity of the authentication process by integrating the validation and authentication functionalities seamlessly within your project.
