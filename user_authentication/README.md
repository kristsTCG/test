# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` consists of two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file containing functions for validating user input. It is 1212 characters long.
- `auth.py`: A Python file responsible for handling user authentication processes. It is 2198 characters long.

## Key Files
### validator.js
The `validator.js` file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is responsible for managing user authentication within the project. It handles user login, registration, and authentication processes. This file is essential for ensuring secure access to the system.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in the `user_authentication` folder, follow these steps:
1. Use the functions defined in `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing authentication requests.
2. Implement the logic defined in `auth.py` to handle user authentication processes, such as user login and registration.

Ensure that you integrate these files seamlessly into your project to maintain secure and reliable user authentication mechanisms.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and a number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is 3-20 characters long and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of the input password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation and strength assessment functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py
