# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized with two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python. These files handle user input validation and user authentication logic respectively.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
   
2. `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication within the project. It includes functions for verifying user credentials, generating tokens, and managing user sessions.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
- Use the functions defined in `validator.js` to validate user input before processing.
- Incorporate the authentication logic from `auth.py` to authenticate users and manage their sessions securely.
