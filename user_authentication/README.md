# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder consists of two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters responsible for user input validation.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters that manage user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file contains functions for validating user input data to ensure it meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is responsible for handling user authentication processes, such as login, logout, and user session management.

## Usage
1. To use the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the necessary functions into your JavaScript files and call them to validate user input data.

Example:
```javascript
import { validateUsername, validatePassword } from './validator.js';

// Validate username
if (validateUsername(username)) {
    // Proceed with authentication
} else {
    // Display error message
}
```

2. In Python scripts, import the `auth.py` file to utilize the authentication functionalities provided.

Example:
```python
from auth import login, logout

# Perform user login
login(username, password)

# Perform user logout
logout()
```
