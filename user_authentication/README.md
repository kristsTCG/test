# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder contains two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters, responsible for validating user input data.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters, handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file is crucial for ensuring that user input data is valid before proceeding with authentication processes. It contains functions for validating various user inputs such as email addresses, passwords, and other relevant data.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is responsible for managing user authentication within the project. It handles processes such as user login, registration, password hashing, and token generation for secure authentication.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation logic and customize it as needed for specific input requirements.
2. Utilize the functions provided in `auth.py` for implementing user authentication features in the project.
3. Ensure to integrate these files with other relevant components of the project for seamless user authentication processes.
