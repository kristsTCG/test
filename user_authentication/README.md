# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It includes scripts for validating user input and handling user authentication using JavaScript and Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` for client-side input validation and `auth.py` for server-side authentication logic.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file (1212 characters) is responsible for validating user input on the client-side. It ensures that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submission.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python script (2198 characters) manages user authentication on the server-side. It handles user login, registration, and authentication processes to ensure secure access to the application.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to suit the project requirements.
   - Include the script in your HTML files using `<script src="path/to/validator.js"></script>`.
   - Call the validation functions on user input fields to enforce validation rules.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Integrate the authentication logic with your backend server.
   - Customize the authentication methods to align with your application's user management system.
   - Ensure proper error handling and security measures are in place to protect user data.

By following the guidelines above, you can effectively utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in the `user_authentication` folder of the project.

- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates a password based on specific criteria (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates a username based on length and character restrictions.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class and call its static methods to perform input validation or password strength assessment.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, logout, and session authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by invalidating the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
