# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input data for authentication purposes. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file consists of 2198 characters and focuses on the authentication logic for users. It handles the verification of user credentials and grants access based on the authentication process.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionalities in this folder:
1. Review and understand the logic implemented in `validator.js` and `auth.py`.
2. Modify the validation criteria in `validator.js` as per project requirements.
3. Integrate the authentication logic from `auth.py` into the project's user authentication flow.
4. Ensure proper error handling and security measures are in place for user authentication processes.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file contains input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates a password based on length and character requirements.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates a username for length and character restrictions.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character complexity.

**Usage:** This file can be imported as a module to perform input validation for user authentication in a Node.js application.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to manage user authentication operations in a Python application.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For representing time intervals.
- `typing`: For type hints.
