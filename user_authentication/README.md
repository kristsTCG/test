# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files, `validator.js` and `auth.py`, which are responsible for validating user input and handling authentication logic, respectively.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Type: JavaScript
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Role: Responsible for validating user input data to ensure it meets the required criteria. This file plays a crucial role in maintaining data integrity and security.

2. **auth.py**
   - Type: Python
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Role: Manages the authentication process for users, including login, registration, and authentication token generation. This file is essential for securing user accounts and managing access control.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**
   - Ensure the `validator.js` file is included in the appropriate modules where user input validation is required.
   - Use the functions provided in `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing it further.
   - Customize the validation criteria as needed to align with the project's requirements.

2. **auth.py**
   - Import the `auth.py` file in modules where user authentication functionalities are needed.
   - Utilize the functions within `auth.py` for user registration, login, and token generation.
   - Implement appropriate error handling and security measures to safeguard user authentication processes.

By following the guidelines outlined in this documentation, developers can effectively utilize the `user_authentication` folder to implement secure and reliable user authentication mechanisms in the project.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the specified criteria (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username meets the specified criteria (3-20 characters, alphanumeric and underscores only).
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of the input password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the provided validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token for active sessions.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by removing the session token from active sessions.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Import the `UserAuth` class from this file to handle user authentication in your Python application.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
