# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes validation logic in JavaScript and authentication logic in Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` for input validation and `auth.py` for user authentication.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters of code dedicated to validating user inputs. It ensures that the data entered by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.

2. `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` consists of 2198 characters of code responsible for handling user authentication. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in the `user_authentication` folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the input validation logic and customize it as needed for your project.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to grasp the user authentication mechanisms implemented and integrate them into your application.
3. Ensure that the code in both files aligns with your project's requirements and security standards before deployment.

- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class in your code and call the desired validation functions or password strength function.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password()`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
