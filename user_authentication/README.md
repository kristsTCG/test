# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files, `validator.js` and `auth.py`, written in JavaScript and Python, respectively.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input and ensuring data integrity during the authentication process. It plays a crucial role in verifying user credentials.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication logic. It manages user login, registration, and session management within the application.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file for input validation functions and customize them as needed.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to understand the authentication logic and integrate it with the rest of the project.
3. Ensure that the necessary dependencies and configurations are set up to support user authentication features effectively.
