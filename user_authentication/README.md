# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes validation logic in JavaScript and authentication logic in Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks. It contains two key files, `validator.js` for input validation and `auth.py` for user authentication.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js` (JavaScript):
   - Role: Handles input validation for user authentication.
   - Size: 1212 characters.
   
2. `auth.py` (Python):
   - Role: Manages user authentication processes.
   - Size: 2198 characters.

## Usage
1. To utilize the input validation functionality, refer to `validator.js`. Modify the validation rules as needed for the project requirements.
   
2. For user authentication tasks, interact with `auth.py`. Implement authentication logic based on the project's authentication requirements.

Ensure to maintain the integrity of user data and security protocols while working with the code in this folder.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength level of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class in your code and call the validation methods as needed.

```javascript
const InputValidator = require('./validator.js');

if (InputValidator.validateEmail('example@example.com')) {
    console.log('Email is valid');
}

const password = 'SecurePass123';
if (InputValidator.validatePassword(password)) {
    console.log('Password meets criteria');
}

const username = 'user123';
if (InputValidator.validateUsername(username)) {
    console.log('Username is valid');
}

const passwordStrength = InputValidator.getPasswordStrength(password);
console.log('Password strength:', passwordStrength);
```

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user authentication operations.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.

- `logout`: Method to end a user session by providing the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and the user is authenticated.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: Used for hashing passwords.
- `json`: Not currently used in the provided code.
- `datetime`: Used for handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: Used for calculating time differences.
