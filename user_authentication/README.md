# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This module handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side validation and auth.py for server-side authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation logic for user inputs. It plays a crucial role in ensuring data integrity and security on the client side.
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for server-side authentication processes. It manages user authentication, session handling, and access control within the application.

## Usage
1. To utilize the client-side validation provided by `validator.js`, include the script in your HTML file using `<script src="path/to/validator.js"></script>`. Then, call the appropriate validation functions as needed in your front-end code.
   
2. For server-side authentication functionalities, import and use `auth.py` in your Python application. Implement the necessary authentication logic and session management based on the requirements of your project.
