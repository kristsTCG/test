# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: Responsible for validating user input data.
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Language: JavaScript

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Manages user authentication processes.
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Language: Python

## Usage
1. **validator.js**
   - Ensure that the necessary JavaScript environment is set up to run the file.
   - Modify the validation rules as needed for user input data.
   - Import and utilize the validation functions in other parts of the project where user input needs to be validated.

2. **auth.py**
   - Make sure the Python environment is configured properly to execute the file.
   - Customize the authentication logic to suit the project's requirements.
   - Integrate the authentication functions into the project's user management system for secure user access control.

By following the guidelines above, developers can effectively utilize the `user_authentication` folder to implement robust user authentication mechanisms in the project.
