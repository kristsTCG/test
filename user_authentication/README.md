# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate the validation logic implemented in JavaScript and the authentication logic implemented in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains the logic for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria.
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication tasks.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules in the `validator.js` file to customize the validation criteria for user input data.
   - Import the `validator.js` file in other parts of the project where user input validation is required.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Utilize the functions defined in `auth.py` for user authentication tasks such as user login, registration, and authentication.
   - Ensure to configure the authentication settings and methods as per the project requirements.

Remember to maintain the integrity of the user authentication processes and follow best practices for secure user data handling.
