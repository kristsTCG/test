# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` contains two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters that handles user input validation.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters responsible for user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
The `validator.js` file is crucial for ensuring that user input is validated before being processed further. It plays a key role in maintaining data integrity and security within the application.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file contains the authentication logic for verifying user credentials and managing user sessions. It is essential for controlling access to protected resources and ensuring secure user authentication.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided by the `user_authentication` folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules applied to user input.
2. Examine the `auth.py` file to understand the authentication processes and session management logic.
3. Integrate the validation and authentication functionalities into the relevant parts of the project where user authentication is required.
4. Ensure that proper error handling mechanisms are in place to handle validation failures and authentication errors effectively.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username allowing only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character complexity.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user authentication operations.
    - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
    - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Method to register a new user.
    - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Method to authenticate a user and return a session token.
    - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Method to end a user session.
    - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Method to check if a session is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to use the provided authentication functionality.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
