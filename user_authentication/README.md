# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles tasks such as validating user input and managing user authentication.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate the validation logic written in JavaScript and the authentication logic written in Python. This separation allows for clear maintenance and scalability of the authentication system.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains the logic for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication tasks. It includes functions for user login, registration, and authentication processes.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - To use the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the necessary functions into your JavaScript files.
   - Call the validation functions with the user input data as parameters to validate the input before proceeding with authentication.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Import the `auth` module into your Python scripts to access the authentication functions.
   - Utilize the provided functions for user login, registration, and authentication within your application.

Ensure to follow the documentation within each file for specific function usage and parameters.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file contains input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username inputs, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on various criteria.

**Usage:** This file can be imported as a module to perform input validation for user authentication tasks.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication processes.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
