# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder contains two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters responsible for validating user input.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file is crucial for ensuring that user input meets the required criteria. It contains functions for validating data such as email addresses, passwords, and other user information.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is essential for managing user authentication within the project. It handles processes such as user login, registration, and authentication checks.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code and call the appropriate validation functions as needed.
2. For user authentication processes, import `auth.py` into your Python code and utilize the functions provided for user login, registration, and authentication checks.
