# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` and `auth.py`, written in JavaScript and Python respectively.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input data for authentication purposes.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file is 2198 characters long and contains the authentication logic for verifying user credentials and managing user sessions.

## Usage
To utilize the functionality provided in this folder:
- Use `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing authentication requests.
- Implement the authentication logic defined in `auth.py` to authenticate users and manage their sessions securely.
