# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is written in Python and is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It includes functions for user login, registration, and authentication.

## Usage
To utilize the functionality provided in this folder, developers can refer to the specific functions within `validator.js` for input validation requirements. For user authentication processes, the `auth.py` file contains the necessary functions and methods to handle user login, registration, and authentication within the project. Developers can integrate these files into their project to implement user authentication features effectively.
