## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes the following key components:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file containing functions for validating user input data.
- `auth.py`: A Python file responsible for handling user authentication logic.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Role**: Contains functions for validating user input data.
- **Size**: 1212 characters
- **Usage**: Used to ensure that user-provided data meets specified criteria before processing.

### auth.py
- **Role**: Manages user authentication processes.
- **Size**: 2198 characters
- **Usage**: Handles user login, registration, and authentication tasks within the project.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Utilize `validator.js` functions to validate user input data before processing.
2. Implement `auth.py` methods for user authentication tasks such as login, registration, and authentication.
3. Ensure proper integration of these files with other project components that require user authentication functionalities.
