# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionality in the project. It includes files for validating user input and handling authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` for client-side validation written in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication logic written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submission.
   
2. `auth.py`: The `auth.py` file handles server-side authentication tasks. It manages user authentication, login, and authorization processes within the application.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to suit the project's requirements.
   - Include the `validator.js` file in your HTML pages using a script tag.
   - Call the validation functions from your form submission logic to validate user input.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Implement additional authentication methods or customize existing ones based on the project's authentication requirements.
   - Integrate the authentication logic with your application's backend services.
   - Ensure proper error handling and secure authentication practices are in place.

By following the guidelines above, you can effectively utilize the user authentication functionality provided in the `user_authentication` folder of the project.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates a password based on specific criteria (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates a username for length and character restrictions.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Method to register a new user.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Method to authenticate a user and return a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Method to end a user session.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Method to check if a session is valid.

**Usage:** Import the `UserAuth` class from this file to implement user authentication in your Python application.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: For handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hinting support.
