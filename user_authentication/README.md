# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` for client-side input validation written in JavaScript, and `auth.py` for server-side authentication logic written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This file contains client-side validation logic to ensure that user input meets specified criteria before submission.
2. `auth.py`: This file contains server-side authentication logic to verify user credentials and manage user authentication processes.

## Usage
1. To work with the client-side validation logic, refer to `validator.js`. Modify the validation rules as needed to suit the project requirements.
2. For server-side authentication tasks, refer to `auth.py`. Implement additional authentication methods or customize the existing logic based on project needs.
