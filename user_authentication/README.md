# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. It includes scripts for validating user inputs and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Type: JavaScript
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Description: This file contains functions for validating user inputs such as email addresses, passwords, and other form data. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria before processing it further.

2. **auth.py**
   - Type: Python
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Description: The `auth.py` file handles the authentication logic for users. It includes functions for user login, registration, password hashing, and session management. This file plays a crucial role in securing user accounts and controlling access to the system.

## Usage
1. To use the `validator.js` file:
   - Import the file into your JavaScript project.
   - Call the validation functions provided in the file to validate user inputs before processing them.
   - Customize the validation criteria as per your project requirements.

2. To work with the `auth.py` file:
   - Import the file into your Python project.
   - Utilize the functions within `auth.py` for user authentication tasks such as login, registration, and password management.
   - Ensure proper integration with your user management system to enhance security and user experience.

By following the guidelines above, you can effectively leverage the user authentication functionalities provided in the `user_authentication` folder of your project.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username inputs, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates an email address based on a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates a password based on specific criteria (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates a username based on specific criteria (3-20 characters, alphanumeric and underscores only).
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing password using SHA-256.
- `json`: For handling JSON data.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hinting.
