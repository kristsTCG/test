# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for client-side validation and `auth.py` written in Python for server-side authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic to ensure that user input meets specified criteria before submission.
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file handles server-side authentication processes, such as verifying user credentials and managing user sessions.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**: To use the client-side validation logic, include `validator.js` in your HTML file using a script tag. You can then call the validation functions defined in this file to validate user input before form submission.
   
2. **auth.py**: To utilize the server-side authentication functionalities, import `auth.py` in your Python project. You can then use the functions provided in this file to authenticate users, manage sessions, and handle login/logout processes. Make sure to configure the necessary settings and endpoints for authentication to work correctly.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength level of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import `validator.js` in your project to utilize the input validation functions provided by the `InputValidator` class.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the session token.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to use the provided user authentication functionalities.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For handling JSON data.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints in function definitions.
