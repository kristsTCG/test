# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This module handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side validation using JavaScript and auth.py for server-side authentication using Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation logic for user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria before submission.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for server-side authentication processes. It manages user authentication, login, and authorization within the application.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to match the project's requirements.
   - Include the `validator.js` file in your HTML pages using `<script src="path/to/validator.js"></script>`.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Implement additional authentication logic as required by the project.
   - Integrate the authentication functionalities provided by `auth.py` into your server-side codebase.

Ensure to maintain the integrity of user authentication processes and handle sensitive user data securely.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates an email address based on a regular expression pattern.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates a password based on specific criteria (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates a username based on length and character restrictions.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character complexity.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class where input validation is needed. For example:
```javascript
const InputValidator = require('./validator.js');

if (InputValidator.validateEmail('example@email.com')) {
    // Email is valid
}

console.log(InputValidator.getPasswordStrength('StrongPassword123'));
```

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib` for hashing functions.
- `json` for JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime` for working with dates and times.
- `timedelta` for time duration calculations.
- `typing` for type hints.
