# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder consists of two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters, responsible for validating user input data.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters, handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file is crucial for ensuring that user input data meets specified criteria and is safe for processing within the application. It contains functions for validating various types of user input, such as email addresses, passwords, and other form data.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is essential for managing user authentication within the project. It handles processes such as user login, registration, password hashing, and token generation for secure access to protected resources.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code and call the appropriate validation functions with user input data.
   
   Example:
   ```javascript
   import { validateEmail, validatePassword } from './validator.js';
   
   const email = 'example@email.com';
   if (validateEmail(email)) {
       // Proceed with processing the email
   } else {
       // Handle invalid email input
   }
   ```

2. For user authentication functionalities provided by `auth.py`, import the file into your Python code and utilize the authentication methods as needed.
   
   Example:
   ```python
   from auth import login, register
   
   username = 'example_user'
   password = 'secure_password'
   
   if login(username, password):
       # User authentication successful
       # Proceed with accessing protected resources
   else:
       # Handle authentication failure
   ``` 

Ensure to follow best practices for user authentication and data validation to maintain the security and integrity of the application.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** This file can be imported as a module to perform input validation tasks in user authentication processes.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies are required for this file.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session by removing the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: Used for hashing passwords.
- `json`: Not used in this file but imported.
- `datetime`: Used for handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: Used for calculating expiration time for session tokens.
- `typing`: Used for type hints.
