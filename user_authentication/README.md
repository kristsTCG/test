# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains the logic for validating user input related to authentication. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is responsible for handling the authentication processes within the project. It manages user login, registration, and authentication mechanisms using Python.

## Usage
To utilize the functionality provided in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the logic in `validator.js` to understand the validation rules applied to user input.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to understand how user authentication processes are implemented using Python.
3. Integrate the validation and authentication logic into your project as needed.
4. Ensure to handle errors and edge cases effectively to enhance the security of user authentication.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file contains input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class from `validator.js` into your code.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Register a new user with username, email, and password.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticate user and return a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: End a user session.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to manage user authentication operations. Call `register_user` to add a new user, `login` to authenticate and get a session token, `logout` to end a session, and `is_authenticated` to check session validity.

**Dependencies:** `hashlib`, `json`, `datetime`, `timedelta`, `typing`
