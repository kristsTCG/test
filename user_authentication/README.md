# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This folder is responsible for validating user input and handling user authentication processes.

## Structure
The `user_authentication` folder consists of two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters that handles input validation for user authentication.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters that manages the authentication logic for users.

## Key Files
### validator.js
The `validator.js` file is crucial for ensuring that user input is validated before proceeding with the authentication process. It contains functions to validate user credentials and prevent malicious input.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is essential for managing the authentication process for users. It includes functions for user login, registration, and authentication verification.

## Usage
To utilize the functionality provided by the `user_authentication` folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the input validation logic.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to grasp the authentication process for users.
3. Integrate the functions from these files into your project to enhance user authentication security.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is 3-20 characters long and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of the input password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication process.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the session token.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
