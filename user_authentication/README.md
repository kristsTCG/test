# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This module handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to support user authentication features. It includes validator.js for client-side validation and auth.py for server-side authentication logic.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation functions for user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring data integrity before submitting it to the server.
- **auth.py**: The Python file auth.py is responsible for server-side authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication using secure methods.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication features in this folder:
1. Use the functions defined in `validator.js` to validate user input on the client side.
2. Incorporate the authentication logic from `auth.py` to handle user login, registration, and authentication on the server side.
3. Ensure to maintain the integrity and security of user data throughout the authentication process.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the specified criteria (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username meets the specified criteria (3-20 characters, alphanumeric and underscores only).
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of the input password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** This file can be imported into other JavaScript files using `require` or `import` statements to perform input validation for user authentication.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the authentication system functions.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For representing a duration of time.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
