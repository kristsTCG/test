# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This module is responsible for validating user input and handling user authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` consists of two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file containing functions for validating user input.
- `auth.py`: A Python file implementing user authentication logic.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Role**: Responsible for validating user input data.
- **Size**: 1212 characters
- **Language**: JavaScript

### auth.py
- **Role**: Implements user authentication logic.
- **Size**: 2198 characters
- **Language**: Python

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the necessary functions into your JavaScript files.
2. Use the functions provided in `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing it further.
3. In Python scripts, import `auth.py` to access user authentication functionalities.
4. Utilize the functions defined in `auth.py` to handle user authentication processes within your Python codebase.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character requirements.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to utilize the input validation functions in your authentication system.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the session token.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to manage user authentication. Call `register_user` to register a new user, `login` to authenticate and get a session token, `logout` to end a session, and `is_authenticated` to check session validity.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib` for password hashing.
- `json` for JSON serialization.
- `datetime` for date and time operations.
- `timedelta` for time duration calculations.
- `typing` for type hints.
