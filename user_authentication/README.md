# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate the validation logic implemented in `validator.js` (JavaScript) and the authentication functionality in `auth.py` (Python).

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains the JavaScript code responsible for validating user input and ensuring data integrity before authentication processes.
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` manages the authentication of users, including login, logout, and session management.

## Usage
Developers can utilize the `validator.js` file to implement client-side validation for user inputs, ensuring data consistency and security. The `auth.py` file provides server-side authentication functionalities, allowing developers to integrate user authentication features seamlessly into the project. Ensure to follow the documentation within each file for proper usage and integration with other project components.
