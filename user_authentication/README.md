# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes the following key components:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file containing functions for validating user input and data.
- `auth.py`: A Python file responsible for handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Role**: Provides functions for validating user input and data.
- **Size**: 1212 characters
- **Usage**: Used to ensure that user-provided data meets specific criteria and is safe for processing.

### auth.py
- **Role**: Manages user authentication processes within the project.
- **Size**: 2198 characters
- **Usage**: Responsible for authenticating users and ensuring secure access to the system.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Use `validator.js` functions to validate user input and data before processing.
2. Utilize `auth.py` for user authentication processes, such as login, logout, and access control.
3. Ensure to maintain the integrity and security of user authentication mechanisms implemented in these files.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username inputs, as well as checking the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates an email address based on a regular expression pattern.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates a password based on specific criteria (length, uppercase, lowercase, and number requirements).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates a username based on length and character restrictions.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the provided validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the authentication system. Call `register_user` to add a new user, `login` to authenticate and get a session token, `logout` to end a session, and `is_authenticated` to check session validity.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For time duration calculations.
- `typing`: For type hints.
