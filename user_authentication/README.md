# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that the data entered by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
  
- `auth.py`: This Python file is 2198 characters long and focuses on handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication tasks within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation criteria for user input data.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to understand how user authentication processes are implemented.
3. Modify the code as needed to integrate user authentication features into your project.
4. Ensure to test the authentication functionalities thoroughly to guarantee secure user interactions.
