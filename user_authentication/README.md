# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes the following key components:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file containing functions for validating user input data.
- `auth.py`: A Python file responsible for handling user authentication logic.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- Role: Validates user input data to ensure it meets specified criteria.
- Size: 1212 characters
- Language: JavaScript

### auth.py
- Role: Manages user authentication processes such as login, registration, and authorization.
- Size: 2198 characters
- Language: Python

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code using `import validator from './validator.js'`. You can then call the validation functions as needed.
   
2. For user authentication functionalities, import `auth.py` into your Python code using `import auth`. Use the functions provided in `auth.py` to handle user login, registration, and authorization processes within your application.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is between 3-20 characters long and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of the input password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user authentication operations.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication system. Call methods like `register_user`, `login`, `logout`, and `is_authenticated` as needed.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For handling JSON data.
- `datetime`: For working with date and time information.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hinting in Python code.
