# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.

2. **auth.py**: This Python file is 2198 characters long and handles the authentication logic for users. It verifies user credentials and manages user sessions securely.

## Usage
To utilize the functionality provided in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation criteria for user input.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to understand the authentication logic and session management.
3. Integrate these files into your project to enable user authentication features.
4. Make necessary adjustments to suit your project's specific requirements.
