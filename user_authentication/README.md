# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder contains two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters responsible for validating user input.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- Role: Responsible for validating user input.
- Size: 1212 characters
- Language: JavaScript

### auth.py
- Role: Handles user authentication processes.
- Size: 2198 characters
- Language: Python

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality, refer to the `validator.js` file and integrate the validation logic into your user input forms.
2. For user authentication processes, utilize the functions and methods provided in the `auth.py` file. Make sure to handle user authentication securely and efficiently.

Ensure that you follow best practices for user authentication and input validation to enhance the security of your application.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file contains input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates an email address based on a regular expression pattern.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates a password based on specific criteria (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates a username based on length and character restrictions.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Method to register a new user.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Method to authenticate a user and return a session token.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Method to end a user session.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Method to check if a session is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to manage user authentication. Call `register_user` to add a new user, `login` to authenticate and get a session token, `logout` to end a session, and `is_authenticated` to check session validity.

**Dependencies:** `hashlib`, `json`, `datetime`, `timedelta`, `Optional`, `Dict`.
