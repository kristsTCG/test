# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes validation logic in JavaScript and authentication logic in Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files, `validator.js` for input validation and `auth.py` for user authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters of code responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the data entered by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
  
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file, written in Python and consisting of 2198 characters, handles user authentication tasks. It verifies user credentials and grants access based on the authentication process.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the input validation criteria.
2. Implement the validation logic in your frontend code to ensure user input meets the required standards.
3. Utilize the `auth.py` file for user authentication tasks. Integrate the authentication logic into your backend system to authenticate users securely.

Ensure that you follow best practices for user authentication and data validation to enhance the security of your application.

- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password and returns a corresponding level.

**Usage:** This file can be imported as a module in other JavaScript files to perform input validation tasks.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies are required for this file.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
