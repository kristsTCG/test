# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user data meets the required criteria before authentication.
   
2. `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication logic. It manages the process of verifying user credentials and granting access to authorized users.

## Usage
To utilize the functionality provided in this folder:
1. Refer to `validator.js` for validating user input before authentication.
2. Utilize `auth.py` for implementing user authentication logic within the project.
3. Ensure that the functions and methods defined in these files are integrated correctly with other components of the project for seamless user authentication.
