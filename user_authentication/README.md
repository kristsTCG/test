# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input data related to authentication. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file contains 2198 characters and handles the authentication logic for users. It verifies user credentials and manages the authentication process within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities within the `user_authentication` folder:
- Review and understand the validation rules implemented in `validator.js`.
- Modify the authentication logic as needed in `auth.py`.
- Integrate these files into the project's authentication system to enhance user security and access control.
