# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file handles the authentication process for users. It likely includes functions for user login, registration, and other authentication-related tasks.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions provided in `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code using `import validator from './validator.js'`. Then, call the necessary validation functions as needed in your application.

2. For the authentication functionalities in `auth.py`, import the file in your Python code using `import auth`. You can then use the functions defined in `auth.py` to manage user authentication processes such as login and registration.

Ensure that you understand the specific functions and methods available in each file to effectively implement user authentication in your project.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numeric characters.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username, allowing alphanumeric characters and underscores within a specific length range.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types, returning a descriptive strength level.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by invalidating the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For handling JSON data.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
