- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Role**: Responsible for validating user inputs.
- **Character Count**: 1212
- **Usage**: Ensures that user input meets specified criteria before processing.

### auth.py
- **Role**: Handles user authentication processes.
- **Character Count**: 2198
- **Usage**: Manages user authentication, login, and logout functionalities.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality:
   - Open `validator.js` and review the validation rules implemented.
