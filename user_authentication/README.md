# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes validation logic in JavaScript and authentication logic in Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks. It contains two key files: `validator.js` for input validation and `auth.py` for user authentication.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains input validation logic for user authentication data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user input meets the required criteria for authentication.
- `auth.py`: This Python file handles user authentication processes such as login, registration, and password management. It is responsible for verifying user credentials and managing user sessions.

## Usage
1. To utilize the input validation logic, refer to `validator.js` and integrate the validation functions into your user authentication forms or processes.
2. For user authentication functionalities, interact with `auth.py` to implement secure login, registration, and password management features in your project. Make sure to handle user sessions securely and follow best practices for authentication.
