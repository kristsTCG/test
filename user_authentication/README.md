# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for handling user authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input to ensure data integrity and security.
- **auth.py**: This file handles user authentication processes such as login, registration, and password management.

## Usage
1. To use the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code and call the appropriate validation functions as needed.
2. For user authentication tasks, utilize the functions provided in `auth.py` by importing the file into your Python project and invoking the necessary authentication methods.

Ensure to follow the documentation and comments within each file for a better understanding of the functions and their parameters.

- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength level of a password based on various criteria.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class in your code and call the respective validation functions or password strength assessment function as needed.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
