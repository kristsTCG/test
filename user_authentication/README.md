# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks. It contains two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This file contains functions for validating user input, ensuring that the data provided by users meets the required criteria for authentication.
- `auth.py`: This file contains authentication logic written in Python, handling the verification of user credentials and granting access based on authentication status.

## Usage
1. To use the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code and call the appropriate validation functions as needed.
2. For authentication tasks, import `auth.py` into your Python code and utilize the authentication logic provided within the file to authenticate users and manage access control.
