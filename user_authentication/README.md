# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
  
- `auth.py`: This Python file is 2198 characters long and handles the authentication logic for users. It manages user login, registration, and other authentication-related tasks within the project.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules applied to user input data.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to understand the authentication logic and processes implemented for user authentication.
3. Make necessary modifications or enhancements to the code as per project requirements, ensuring compatibility with the existing authentication system.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates a password based on specific criteria (length, uppercase, lowercase, and number requirements).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates a username for length and allowed characters.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class in your code and call the desired validation functions or password strength assessment function.

```javascript
const InputValidator = require('./validator.js');

const email = 'example@example.com';
const isEmailValid = InputValidator.validateEmail(email);

const password = 'StrongPassword123';
const isPasswordValid = InputValidator.validatePassword(password);

const username = 'user123';
const isUsernameValid = InputValidator.validateUsername(username);

const passwordStrength = InputValidator.getPasswordStrength(password);
```

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON handling.
- `datetime`: For date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For time calculations.
- `typing`: For type hints.
