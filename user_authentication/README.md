# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized with two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file containing functions for validating user input.
- `auth.py`: A Python file handling authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file contains functions for validating user input, ensuring data integrity and security.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is responsible for managing user authentication processes, such as login, registration, and password management.

## Usage
1. Use `validator.js` functions to validate user input before processing it further.
2. Utilize `auth.py` for implementing user authentication features like login, registration, and password management.
3. Ensure to maintain the integrity and security of user data by following the validation and authentication processes defined in these files.
