# user_authentication

## Overview
The user_authentication folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder consists of two key files: validator.js for client-side input validation written in JavaScript, and auth.py for server-side authentication logic written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input on the client-side. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submission.
- **auth.py**: This file handles server-side authentication processes such as user login, registration, and session management. It is responsible for verifying user credentials and granting access to protected resources.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Import the validator.js file into your HTML or JavaScript files where input validation is required.
   - Utilize the provided validation functions to check user input before submitting forms or making requests.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Integrate the auth.py file into your server-side codebase, ensuring it is accessible for user authentication processes.
   - Use the authentication functions within auth.py to manage user login, registration, and session handling in your application.

Ensure that both client-side and server-side authentication processes are synchronized to provide a secure and seamless user experience.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric and underscore characters.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength level of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation methods in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies required for this file.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the session token.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
