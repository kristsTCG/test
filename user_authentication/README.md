# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It is responsible for validating user input and handling user authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` consists of two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters that handles input validation for user authentication.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters that manages user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file is crucial for ensuring that user input for authentication is valid and meets the required criteria. It plays a significant role in preventing malicious input and maintaining data integrity.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is essential for managing user authentication within the project. It handles tasks such as user login, registration, password hashing, and token generation. This file is critical for ensuring secure access to the system.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided by the `user_authentication` folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the input validation requirements for user authentication.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to familiarize yourself with the user authentication processes implemented in the project.
3. Integrate the validation logic from `validator.js` into your user input forms to ensure data integrity.
4. Utilize the functions and methods defined in `auth.py` to implement secure user authentication mechanisms in your project.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file contains input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on various criteria.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token if successful.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the session token.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to use the provided user authentication functionalities.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints (not used in this file).
