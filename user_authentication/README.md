# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input data related to authentication processes.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file contains 2198 characters and handles the authentication logic for users, such as login, registration, and session management.

## Usage
To utilize the functionality provided in this folder:
- Ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed for both JavaScript and Python.
- Refer to `validator.js` for validating user input data before processing authentication requests.
- Use `auth.py` for implementing user authentication features like login, registration, and managing user sessions.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if a password meets the criteria of being at least 8 characters long with uppercase, lowercase, and a number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if a username is between 3-20 characters long and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on its length and character composition.

**Usage:** This file can be imported into other JavaScript files using `require` or `import` statements to perform input validation for user authentication.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** User authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For handling date and time.
- `timedelta`: For time-based calculations.
- `typing`: For type hints.
