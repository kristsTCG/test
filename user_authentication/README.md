# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It includes functions for user login, registration, and authentication checks.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
- Use the `validator.js` file to validate user input data before processing it for authentication.
- Refer to the `auth.py` file for implementing user authentication processes such as user login, registration, and authentication checks.

Ensure to maintain the integrity of user data and follow best practices for secure authentication procedures.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates that a password meets specific criteria (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates that a username is 3-20 characters long and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** This file can be imported into other JavaScript files using `require` or `import` statements.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash passwords using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token for active sessions.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by removing the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Import the `UserAuth` class from this file to handle user authentication in your Python application.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
