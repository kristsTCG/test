# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. This includes validation of user inputs and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is structured to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This file contains functions for validating user inputs such as email addresses, passwords, and other user data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring the integrity and security of user information.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file handles the authentication process for users. It includes functions for user login, registration, and password management. `auth.py` is responsible for verifying user credentials and granting access to authorized users.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Use `validator.js` functions to validate user inputs before processing them further.
2. Utilize `auth.py` functions for user authentication tasks such as login, registration, and password management.
3. Ensure to integrate these files with other parts of the project that require user authentication functionalities.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file contains input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of being at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and a number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is 3-20 characters long and consists of alphanumeric characters and underscores only.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of the input password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** This file can be imported using `require` or `import` statements to perform input validation for user authentication in a Node.js application.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies are required for this file.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password()`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user()`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login()`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout()`: Method to end a user session.
- `is_authenticated()`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** This file can be imported to handle user authentication in Python applications.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
