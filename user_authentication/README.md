# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input data for authentication purposes.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python file contains 2198 characters and handles the authentication logic for users within the system.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionalities in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file for user input validation logic.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to understand the authentication process for users.
3. Modify or extend the code in these files as needed to suit the project requirements.

- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username, allowing alphanumeric characters and underscores within a specific length range.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types, returning a descriptive level.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to access the validation methods.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py
