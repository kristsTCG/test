# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate the validation logic in JavaScript and the authentication logic in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains the user validation logic, consisting of 1212 characters. It is responsible for validating user input and ensuring data integrity.
- `auth.py`: This Python file contains the authentication logic, consisting of 2198 characters. It handles user authentication processes, such as login, logout, and session management.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionalities in this folder:
1. Modify the `validator.js` file to customize the validation rules according to project requirements.
2. Utilize the functions defined in `auth.py` for user authentication processes, integrating them into the project's user management system.
