# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes the following key components:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file containing functions for validating user input.
- `auth.py`: A Python file responsible for handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Role**: Validates user input data.
- **Size**: 1212 characters
- **Usage**: Ensures that user-provided data meets specified criteria before processing.

### auth.py
- **Role**: Manages user authentication processes.
- **Size**: 2198 characters
- **Usage**: Handles user login, registration, and authentication tasks.

## Usage
1. Use `validator.js` to validate user input data by calling the appropriate validation functions.
2. Utilize `auth.py` for user authentication tasks such as login, registration, and authentication processes.
3. Ensure to follow the defined structure and functions within each file for seamless user authentication implementation.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file contains input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and a number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is between 3-20 characters, alphanumeric, and underscores only.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** This file can be imported using `require` or `import` statements to access the input validation functions.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token for active sessions.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by invalidating the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is still valid for authentication.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
