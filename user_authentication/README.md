# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` for client-side input validation in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication logic in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: Responsible for validating user input on the client-side.
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Language: JavaScript

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Manages server-side authentication processes.
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Language: Python

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Ensure the file is linked in your HTML file using `<script src="path/to/validator.js"></script>`.
   - Use the functions provided in `validator.js` to validate user input before submitting forms.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Integrate the authentication logic into your server-side codebase.
   - Utilize the functions and classes defined in `auth.py` to handle user authentication securely.

Remember to maintain the integrity and security of user authentication processes by following best practices and keeping the codebase up to date with the latest security standards.
