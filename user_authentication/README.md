# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This functionality is responsible for validating user input and managing user authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` consists of two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters, responsible for validating user input.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters, responsible for handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
The `validator.js` file is crucial for ensuring that user input is validated correctly before proceeding with authentication processes. It contains functions and logic for validating various user inputs such as email addresses, passwords, and other relevant data.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is essential for managing user authentication within the project. It handles processes such as user login, registration, password resets, and other authentication-related tasks. This file interacts with the database and other parts of the system to authenticate users securely.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation logic and functions available for validating user input.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to understand how user authentication processes are handled within the project.
3. Use the functions and logic provided in these files to integrate user authentication functionality into other parts of the project as needed.
