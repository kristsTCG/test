# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes a JavaScript file for validation logic and a Python file for handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files for validation and authentication operations.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters of code responsible for validating user input data for authentication purposes.
   
2. **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is crucial for handling user authentication processes. It consists of 2198 characters of code dedicated to managing user authentication, such as login, registration, and session handling.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
1. Review the code in `validator.js` for understanding the validation logic implemented.
2. Explore `auth.py` to comprehend the authentication processes and functions available.
3. Integrate these files into your project to enable user authentication features.
