# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This functionality is responsible for validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` contains two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters that handles input validation for user authentication.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters that manages the authentication process for users.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Role**: Responsible for validating user input for authentication.
- **Character Count**: 1212
- **Language**: JavaScript

### auth.py
- **Role**: Manages the authentication process for users.
- **Character Count**: 2198
- **Language**: Python

## Usage
1. To utilize the input validation functionality, refer to the `validator.js` file and integrate it into the relevant parts of the project where user input validation is required.
2. For user authentication processes, utilize the `auth.py` file by importing its functions and methods into the appropriate modules where user authentication is needed.
3. Ensure to follow the coding standards and guidelines set within the files to maintain consistency and readability in the authentication-related code.
