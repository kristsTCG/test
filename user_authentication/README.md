# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This functionality is responsible for validating user input and handling user authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication logic in both JavaScript and Python. The key components include a JavaScript file for validation (`validator.js`) and a Python file for authentication (`auth.py`).

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria for authentication.
- `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` handles user authentication processes. It includes functions for verifying user credentials and managing user sessions.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionality in this folder:
1. Use the functions provided in `validator.js` to validate user input before processing authentication.
2. Incorporate the authentication logic from `auth.py` to authenticate users based on their credentials.
3. Ensure that the functions in both files are integrated seamlessly with the rest of the project's authentication flow.

Remember to adhere to best practices for user authentication and security when working with the code in this folder.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file contains input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username inputs, as well as determining the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class into your code. You can then call the validation methods as needed.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session management, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token for active sessions.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session by removing the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For representing a duration of time.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
