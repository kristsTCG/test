# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate the validation logic in `validator.js` (JavaScript) and the authentication logic in `auth.py` (Python). Both files work together to ensure secure user authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains the validation logic for user input. It ensures that the data entered by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling the authentication process. It verifies user credentials and grants access based on the authentication rules defined within the project.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**: To use the validation logic provided in `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code using `import validator from './validator.js'`. You can then call the validation functions as needed to validate user input.

2. **auth.py**: In your Python code, import the `auth.py` file using `import auth`. Use the authentication functions provided in `auth.py` to authenticate users based on the defined rules and logic.

3. Ensure to handle any errors or exceptions that may arise during the validation and authentication processes to provide a smooth user experience and enhance security.
