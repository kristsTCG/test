# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for authentication logic.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input, ensuring data integrity and security.
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is responsible for handling user authentication processes, such as login, logout, and session management.

## Usage
1. To utilize the input validation functionality, refer to the `validator.js` file and incorporate the validation functions into your code where necessary.
2. For user authentication tasks, interact with the `auth.py` file to implement secure login and session management features within the project.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file provides a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.

- `logout`: Method to end a user session based on the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize user authentication functionalities like registration, login, logout, and session validation.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib` for password hashing.
- `json` for JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime` for handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta` for calculating time differences.
