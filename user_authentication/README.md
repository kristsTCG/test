# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This functionality is responsible for validating user input and managing user authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` contains two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters responsible for validating user input.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters responsible for handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file contains functions for validating user input data, ensuring that it meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is crucial for managing user authentication within the project. It handles processes such as user login, registration, and authentication token generation.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Utilize the functions in `validator.js` to validate user input data before authentication processes.
2. Use the functionalities provided in `auth.py` to manage user authentication processes, including login, registration, and token generation.

Ensure that any modifications or additions to these files adhere to the project's user authentication requirements and standards.
