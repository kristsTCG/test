# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria and format.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file is 2198 characters long and handles the authentication process for users. It verifies user credentials and grants access to authorized users.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided by this folder:
- Use the `validator.js` file to validate user input data before processing it further.
- Implement the authentication logic defined in the `auth.py` file to secure user access to the system.

Ensure that these files are integrated into the project's authentication flow to enhance security and user experience.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username inputs, as well as determining the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric and underscores only.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character requirements.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Method to register a new user.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Method to authenticate a user and return a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Method to end a user session.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Method to check if a session is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For handling JSON data.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints in function definitions.
