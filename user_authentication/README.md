# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` for client-side input validation written in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication logic written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: Responsible for client-side input validation.
   - Size: 1212 characters.
   
2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Manages server-side authentication processes.
   - Size: 2198 characters.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**
   - Ensure the `validator.js` file is included in your HTML file where user input validation is required.
   - Modify the validation rules and error messages as needed.
   - Call the validation functions from your form submission logic.

2. **auth.py**
   - Import the `auth.py` module in your server-side code where authentication is required.
   - Utilize the provided authentication functions for user login, registration, and session management.
   - Customize the authentication logic to integrate with your project's user management system.

Remember to maintain the integrity and security of user authentication processes by following best practices and keeping the code up to date with any security patches.

- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates that a password meets specific criteria (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates that a username is 3-20 characters long and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py
