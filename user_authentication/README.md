# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes scripts for validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input data related to authentication. It ensures that the data entered by the user meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file is 2198 characters long and manages the authentication process for users. It handles user login, registration, and authentication logic using Python.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
- Use `validator.js` to validate user input data for authentication.
- Implement the logic in `auth.py` to manage user authentication processes such as login and registration.

Ensure that the files are integrated into the project's authentication flow as needed.
