# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for authentication logic.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
   
2. `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication logic. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the application.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the input validation logic and make necessary adjustments based on project requirements.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to understand the authentication processes implemented in the project and customize them as needed.
3. Integrate these files into your project's authentication system to enhance user security and data validation.
