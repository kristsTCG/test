# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. This module is responsible for validating user input and handling user authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` contains two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters, responsible for validating user input data.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters, responsible for handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file is crucial for ensuring that user input data is validated before being processed further. It contains functions to validate user input such as email addresses, passwords, and other relevant data.

### auth.py
This Python file is essential for managing user authentication processes within the project. It handles user login, registration, and authentication logic. Additionally, it interacts with the database to verify user credentials and manage user sessions.

## Usage
1. To work with the `validator.js` file:
   - Review the existing validation functions and customize them as needed for specific input data requirements.
   - Import the functions into other modules where user input validation is required.

2. To work with the `auth.py` file:
   - Use the provided functions for user registration, login, and authentication processes.
   - Ensure that the database connection details are correctly configured for seamless interaction with the database.
   - Integrate the authentication logic into the relevant parts of the project where user authentication is required.

By following the guidelines provided in the key files section, developers can effectively utilize the user authentication functionalities in the project.
