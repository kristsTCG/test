# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user data is correctly formatted before submission.
- **auth.py**: This Python file handles server-side authentication processes. It manages user authentication, login, and access control within the application.

## Usage
1. To utilize the client-side validation functionality, refer to `validator.js`. Modify the validation rules as needed to suit the project requirements.
2. For server-side authentication tasks, interact with `auth.py`. Implement additional authentication logic or customize the existing functionality to align with the project's security needs.
