# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This module is responsible for validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate the validation logic in `validator.js` (JavaScript) and the authentication functionality in `auth.py` (Python). This separation allows for clear maintenance and scalability of the authentication module.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains the JavaScript code for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file contains the Python code for handling user authentication processes. It includes functions for user login, registration, and authentication checks.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to suit the project's requirements.
   - Ensure that the validation logic aligns with the specific data input fields in the authentication process.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Import and utilize the functions provided in `auth.py` for user authentication within the project.
   - Customize the authentication logic to integrate with the project's user management system.

Ensure that any changes made to these files are thoroughly tested to maintain the security and integrity of the user authentication process.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is 3-20 characters long and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file provides a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization/deserialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
