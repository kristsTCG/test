# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for authentication logic.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file handles the authentication logic for verifying user credentials and granting access to authorized users. It is responsible for managing user sessions and authentication tokens.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review and understand the functions defined in `validator.js` for input validation requirements.
2. Utilize the functions provided in `auth.py` to implement user authentication mechanisms in the project.
3. Ensure to integrate these files with other components of the project that require user authentication functionalities.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validation of email, password, and username formats, as well as determining the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character requirements.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the provided validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user's session based on the session token.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For handling JSON data.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
