## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder consists of two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file containing functions for validating user input. It is 1212 characters long.
- `auth.py`: A Python file responsible for handling user authentication processes. It is 2198 characters long.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file contains functions for validating user input, ensuring data integrity and security.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file manages user authentication processes such as login, registration, and password management.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Use the functions in `validator.js` to validate user input before processing.
2. Utilize the functionalities in `auth.py` for user authentication processes within the project.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is between 3-20 characters and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of the input password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** User authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class managing user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to manage user registration, login, and session handling.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON operations.
- `datetime`: For date and time handling.
- `timedelta`: For time duration calculations.
- `typing`: For type hints.
