# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It includes files responsible for validating user input and handling authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication processes efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Language: JavaScript
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Role: Responsible for validating user input data related to authentication processes. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria for authentication.

2. **auth.py**
   - Language: Python
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Role: Manages the authentication logic within the system. This file handles user authentication, login, and authorization processes using Python.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review `validator.js` to understand the validation rules applied to user input data for authentication.
2. Examine `auth.py` to understand the authentication logic and processes implemented in Python.
3. Modify the code as needed to customize authentication functionalities for your project.
4. Ensure that any changes made adhere to security best practices to protect user data and privacy.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username inputs, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets complexity requirements.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username meets length and character requirements.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength level of a given password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class in your code and call the validation methods as needed.

```javascript
const InputValidator = require('./validator.js');

if (InputValidator.validateEmail('example@email.com')) {
    console.log('Email is valid');
}

const passwordStrength = InputValidator.getPasswordStrength('SecurePassword123');
console.log('Password strength:', passwordStrength);
```

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user authentication operations.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
