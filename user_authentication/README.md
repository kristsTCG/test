# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains code for validating user input and ensuring data integrity during the authentication process. It plays a crucial role in verifying user credentials.
   
2. `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication logic. It manages user sessions, login/logout functionality, and authentication checks.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the code in `validator.js` to understand the validation rules and data integrity checks applied during user authentication.
2. Explore `auth.py` to grasp the authentication logic, session management, and login/logout mechanisms implemented in Python.
3. Integrate these files into your project to enable secure user authentication processes.
4. Ensure to follow best practices for user authentication and data security while working with the code in this folder.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates a password based on length and character requirements.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates a username for length and character constraints.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on various criteria.

**Usage:** To use this file, import it as `InputValidator` in your JavaScript code. You can then call the validation functions and password strength assessment function as needed.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Method to register a new user.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Method to authenticate a user and return a session token.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Method to end a user session.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Method to check if a session is valid.

**Usage:** Import the `UserAuth` class from this file to handle user authentication in your application.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For representing time intervals.
- `typing.Optional`: For type hinting optional return values.
- `typing.Dict`: For type hinting dictionary types.
