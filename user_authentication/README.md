# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input related to authentication. It ensures that the data entered by the user meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file is 2198 characters long and handles the authentication logic for users. It manages the process of verifying user credentials and granting access to authorized users.

## Usage
To utilize the code in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules for user input.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to comprehend the authentication process and how user credentials are verified.
3. Integrate these files into the project's authentication system as needed, ensuring proper error handling and security measures are in place.

- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is 3-20 characters long, alphanumeric, and contains underscores only.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of the input password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** This file can be imported as a module in other JavaScript files to perform input validation for user authentication.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py
