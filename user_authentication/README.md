# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Type: JavaScript
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Role: Responsible for validating user input data and ensuring it meets specified criteria for authentication.

2. **auth.py**
   - Type: Python
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Role: Manages the authentication process, including user login, registration, and token generation.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**
   - Modify the validation criteria in the `validator.js` file to customize the user input validation process.
   - Ensure the functions in `validator.js` are called appropriately within the authentication flow.

2. **auth.py**
   - Use the functions provided in `auth.py` to handle user authentication tasks such as login and registration.
   - Integrate token generation and verification logic from `auth.py` into the overall authentication flow.

Ensure to maintain the integrity of the authentication process and handle user data securely throughout the project.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username inputs, as well as determining the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates that a password meets specific criteria (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates that a username is 3-20 characters long and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on its length and character composition.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the provided validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the session token.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to manage user registration, login, logout, and session validation.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: for hashing functions.
- `json`: for JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: for handling date and time.
- `timedelta`: for time-based calculations.
- `typing`: for type hints.
