# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It includes validation logic in JavaScript and authentication logic in Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks. It contains two key files: `validator.js` for input validation and `auth.py` for user authentication.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains input validation logic for user authentication data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user input meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
  
- `auth.py`: This Python file handles user authentication processes such as login, registration, and session management. It is responsible for verifying user credentials and granting access to authorized users.

## Usage
1. To utilize the input validation logic, refer to the `validator.js` file and integrate the validation functions into your user authentication forms or processes.
2. For user authentication functionalities, interact with the `auth.py` file to implement secure login and registration processes within your project.
3. Ensure to follow best practices for user authentication and security when incorporating code from this folder into your project.
