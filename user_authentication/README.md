# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It includes scripts for validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. **auth.py**: The Python script `auth.py` handles the authentication logic within the project. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules applied to user input.
2. Explore the `auth.py` script to familiarize yourself with the authentication logic implemented in Python.
3. Integrate these scripts into your project as needed to enable secure user authentication processes.
