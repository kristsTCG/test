# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This module is responsible for validating user inputs and managing user authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` consists of two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters that handles input validation for user authentication.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters that manages the authentication process for users.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Role**: Responsible for validating user inputs for authentication.
- **Character Count**: 1212
- **Usage**: Ensures that user input data meets the required criteria before proceeding with the authentication process.

### auth.py
- **Role**: Manages the authentication process for users.
- **Character Count**: 2198
- **Usage**: Handles user authentication, including login, registration, and password management.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Use `validator.js` to validate user inputs before initiating the authentication process.
2. Utilize `auth.py` for managing user authentication tasks such as login, registration, and password handling.

**Usage:** This file can be imported as a module to perform input validation in user authentication processes.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** User authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class managing user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the session token.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Import the `UserAuth` class from this file to handle user authentication in your application.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
