# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication logic efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user inputs and ensuring data integrity. It plays a crucial role in validating user information before authentication.
   
2. `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It includes functions for user login, registration, and authentication.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities in this folder:
1. Review the code in `validator.js` to understand the validation logic and customize it as needed.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to implement user authentication features in the project.
3. Ensure to integrate these files with the rest of the project's codebase for seamless user authentication processes.
