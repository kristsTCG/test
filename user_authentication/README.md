# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes validation logic in JavaScript and authentication logic in Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks. The key components include a JavaScript file for data validation and a Python file for user authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains logic for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication within the system.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation logic as needed to enforce specific data requirements.
   - Import and use the validation functions in other parts of the project where user input needs to be validated.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Use the functions provided in `auth.py` to implement user authentication features in the project.
   - Customize the authentication logic to integrate with the project's user management system.

Ensure that any changes made to these files are thoroughly tested to maintain the security and integrity of the user authentication system.
