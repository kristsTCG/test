# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submission.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python file handles server-side authentication processes. It manages user authentication, login, and access control within the application.

## Usage
1. To utilize the client-side validation logic, refer to `validator.js` for functions and methods related to input validation.
   
2. For server-side authentication tasks, such as user login and access control, refer to `auth.py` for relevant functions and classes.

3. Ensure that both client-side and server-side authentication processes are synchronized to provide a seamless user authentication experience.
