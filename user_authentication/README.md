# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user inputs and ensuring data integrity during the authentication process.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file is 2198 characters long and manages the authentication logic, including user login, registration, and session management.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionalities, refer to `validator.js` and integrate the validation methods into your user input forms.
   
2. For user authentication tasks such as login and registration, utilize the functions provided in `auth.py` to handle user authentication securely.

Ensure to follow best practices and security measures when working with user authentication processes.
