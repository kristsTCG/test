# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input, ensuring data integrity and security in the authentication process.
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file handles user authentication logic, such as user login, registration, and token generation.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file for input validation functions and ensure they are integrated into the user authentication flow.
2. Utilize the `auth.py` file for implementing user authentication features such as login, registration, and token management.
3. Ensure proper error handling and security measures are in place when using the code from this folder.
