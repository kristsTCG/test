# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submission.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file handles server-side authentication processes. It manages user authentication, login, and session management within the application.

## Usage
1. To utilize the client-side validation logic, refer to `validator.js` and integrate it with your front-end code to validate user input before submitting forms.
   
2. For server-side authentication tasks, utilize `auth.py` to handle user authentication processes, manage user sessions, and implement secure login mechanisms within the application.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength level of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class from `validator.js` in your code.

```javascript
const InputValidator = require('./validator.js');
```

You can then use the validation methods provided by the `InputValidator` class.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticate a user and return a session token.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: End a user session by invalidating the session token.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Check if a session token is valid and the user is authenticated.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to use the provided authentication functionalities.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: For handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hinting in Python.
