# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input data for authentication purposes.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file contains 2198 characters and handles the authentication logic for verifying user credentials and managing user sessions.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand how user input data is validated before authentication.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to understand the authentication process and how user credentials are verified.
3. Modify the code as needed to customize user authentication functionalities for the project.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Assesses the strength of a password based on length and character requirements.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class in your code. You can then call the validation functions and password strength assessment function as needed.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, logout, and session authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token for active sessions.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by removing the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** This file can be imported into other Python scripts to handle user authentication tasks.

**Dependencies:**
