# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring the integrity and security of user-provided information.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file handles user authentication processes such as login, registration, and session management. It is responsible for verifying user credentials and granting access to authorized users.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
- Use the functions defined in `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing it further.
- Utilize the functionalities provided in `auth.py` to implement secure user authentication mechanisms in the project.
- Ensure to follow best practices for user authentication and data validation to enhance the security of the application.
