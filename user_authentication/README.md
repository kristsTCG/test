# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` for client-side input validation written in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication logic written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: Responsible for client-side input validation.
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Language: JavaScript

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Manages server-side authentication processes.
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Language: Python

## Usage
1. **validator.js**
   - Ensure the file is linked appropriately in your HTML files to enable client-side validation.
   - Customize validation rules as needed by modifying the JavaScript functions.
   
2. **auth.py**
   - Integrate the authentication logic into your server-side codebase.
   - Use the functions provided in `auth.py` for user authentication and authorization processes.

Remember to maintain the integrity of the authentication system and handle user data securely to prevent unauthorized access.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates a password based on specific criteria (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates a username for length (3-20 characters) and allowed characters (alphanumeric and underscores).
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token for active sessions.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by removing the session token from active sessions.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Import the `UserAuth` class from this file to handle user authentication in your Python application.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not directly used in this file).
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating expiration time for session tokens.
- `typing.Optional`, `typing.Dict`: For type hints in function signatures.
