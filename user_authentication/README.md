# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` contains two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters that handles input validation for user authentication.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters that implements the authentication logic for users.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file is responsible for validating user input for authentication purposes. It ensures that the data entered by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file contains the authentication logic for users. It handles the process of verifying user credentials and granting access to authorized users.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the input validation criteria for user authentication.
2. Examine the `auth.py` file to understand the authentication logic and how user credentials are verified.
3. Make necessary modifications or enhancements to the validation and authentication processes as needed for your project.
