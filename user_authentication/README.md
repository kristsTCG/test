# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions to validate user input data, ensuring it meets the required criteria for authentication.
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` manages the authentication process, including user login, registration, and token generation.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation logic and criteria for user input data.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to implement user authentication processes such as login, registration, and token generation.
3. Integrate these files into your project to enhance user authentication security and functionality.

- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the provided validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** User authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class managing user authentication operations.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Register a new user with username, email, and password.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticate user and return a session token.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: End a user session.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization/deserialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For representing time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
