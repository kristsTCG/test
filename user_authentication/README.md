# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file consists of 2198 characters and manages the authentication process for users. It handles user login, registration, and authentication logic.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in the `user_authentication` folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules and criteria for user input data.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to comprehend the authentication logic and processes implemented for user registration and login.
3. Integrate the validation and authentication functionalities from these files into your project as needed.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username inputs, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on various criteria.

**Usage:** This file can be imported into other JavaScript files using `require` or `import` statements to perform input validation for user authentication processes.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies and can be used independently for input validation tasks.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session management, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash passwords using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.

- `logout`: Method to end a user session based on the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to interact with user authentication functionalities.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For handling dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
