# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes a JavaScript file for validation and a Python file for handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files, `validator.js` for client-side validation and `auth.py` for server-side authentication.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation logic for user inputs. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submission.
   
2. `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for server-side authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication within the application.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in the `user_authentication` folder, follow these steps:
1. Use `validator.js` in your front-end code to validate user inputs before submitting forms.
2. Incorporate `auth.py` into your server-side code to handle user authentication processes securely.

Ensure that both files are integrated correctly into your project to maintain a robust user authentication system.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password and returns a corresponding level.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user authentication operations.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Method to register a new user.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Method to authenticate a user and return a session token.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Method to end a user session.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Method to check if a session is valid.

**Usage:** Import the `UserAuth` class from this file to handle user authentication in your Python application.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For representing time durations.
- `typing.Optional`: For type hinting optional return values.
