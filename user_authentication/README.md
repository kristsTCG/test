# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user data is correctly formatted before submission.
- **auth.py**: This Python file handles server-side authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication using secure methods.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**: To use the validation logic in this file, include it in your HTML file using a script tag. You can then call the validation functions provided within this file to validate user input before submitting forms.
   
2. **auth.py**: This file is used on the server-side to manage user authentication. Import and use the functions provided in this file to handle user login, registration, and authentication processes securely. Ensure that proper error handling and security measures are implemented when integrating this file into your project.
