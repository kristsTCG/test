# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. It includes scripts for validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python script `auth.py` is responsible for managing user authentication processes. It handles tasks such as user login, registration, and authentication verification.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionality provided in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Use the functions defined in `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing it for authentication.
2. Incorporate the authentication logic from `auth.py` into your application to enable user registration, login, and authentication verification.

Ensure that you understand the functions and methods defined in these files to effectively implement user authentication in your project.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of being at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and a number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is 3-20 characters long and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of the input password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file and use its static methods for input validation.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token for active sessions.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session based on the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hinting (not used in this file).
