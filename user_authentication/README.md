# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It includes validation logic in JavaScript and authentication logic in Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication processes. The key components include a JavaScript file for data validation and a Python file for user authentication.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters of code responsible for validating user input data for authentication purposes.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file, with 2198 characters, handles user authentication processes within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the code in this folder:
- Use `validator.js` for validating user input data before authentication.
- Implement the authentication logic using the functions provided in `auth.py`.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength evaluation.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric and underscore characters.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Evaluates the strength of a password and returns a descriptive level.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use its validation and strength evaluation methods in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class managing user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token for active sessions.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the provided session token.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid and the session is still active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: Used for hashing passwords.
- `json`: Used for JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: Used for handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: Used for calculating time differences.
- `typing`: Used for type hinting in function definitions.
