# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input, ensuring data integrity and security.
- `auth.py`: This Python file implements the authentication logic for verifying user credentials and managing user sessions.

## Usage
Developers can utilize the `validator.js` functions to validate user input before processing it further. The `auth.py` module provides authentication functionality, allowing users to securely log in and manage their sessions within the application. To integrate user authentication features into the project, import and use these files as needed.
