# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Language: JavaScript
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Role: Responsible for validating user input data and ensuring it meets the required criteria for authentication.

2. **auth.py**
   - Language: Python
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Role: Manages the authentication process, including verifying user credentials and granting access based on authentication rules.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**
   - To use the `validator.js` file, import it into your JavaScript code using `import validator from './validator.js';`.
   - Utilize the functions provided in `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing authentication.

2. **auth.py**
   - To work with `auth.py`, import it into your Python code using `import auth`.
   - Use the functions and methods defined in `auth.py` to authenticate users, verify credentials, and manage user access within the application.

Ensure to follow the coding standards and guidelines set for the user authentication module to maintain consistency and security in the authentication process.
