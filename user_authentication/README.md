## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` contains two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters, responsible for validating user input data.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters, handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file is crucial for ensuring that user input data is validated before being processed. It contains functions to validate various types of user input, such as email addresses, passwords, and other user information.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is responsible for handling user authentication processes within the project. It includes functions for user login, registration, password reset, and other authentication-related tasks.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation logic and functions available for validating user input.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to understand how user authentication processes are implemented in the project.
3. Use the functions provided in these files to integrate user authentication functionalities into other parts of the project as needed.
