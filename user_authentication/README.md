# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user data is correctly formatted and meets the required criteria.
   
2. `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It includes functions for user login, registration, and authentication.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
- Use the functions defined in `validator.js` to validate user input before processing it.
- Import and utilize the functions from `auth.py` in your Python code to implement user authentication features.

Ensure that you understand the logic and flow of the code in these files to effectively integrate user authentication into your project.

- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the specified criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username meets the specified criteria.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength level of the input password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class in your code and call the desired validation functions or password strength calculation function.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
