# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication logic within the project.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation logic for user input.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to grasp the authentication processes implemented in Python.
3. Use the functions and classes provided in these files to integrate user authentication features into the project.
