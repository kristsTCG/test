# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles tasks such as validating user input and managing user authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate different aspects of user authentication. The key components include a JavaScript file for validation logic and a Python file for handling authentication processes.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input related to authentication. It ensures that the data entered by users meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python file contains 2198 characters and is crucial for managing user authentication processes. It handles tasks such as user login, registration, and authentication verification.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation logic, refer to the `validator.js` file and integrate the validation functions into the relevant parts of the project where user input needs to be validated.
  
2. For user authentication processes, utilize the functions and methods defined in the `auth.py` file. This includes handling user login, registration, and authentication verification within the project.

3. Ensure to maintain the integrity of the authentication functionalities by regularly updating and enhancing the validation and authentication processes as needed.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the specified criteria (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username meets the specified criteria (3-20 characters, alphanumeric and underscores only).
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of the input password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, logout, and session authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session by invalidating the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and not expired.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations like registration, login, logout, and session validation.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints (not used in this file).
