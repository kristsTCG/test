# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` contains two key files: `validator.js` and `auth.py`. These files are responsible for validating user input and handling user authentication, respectively.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file handles user authentication processes. It includes functions for verifying user credentials, generating tokens, and managing user sessions.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in the `user_authentication` folder:
1. Use the functions defined in `validator.js` to validate user input before processing authentication requests.
2. Import and utilize the functions from `auth.py` to authenticate users, manage user sessions, and handle token generation.

Ensure that you follow the documentation and code comments within each file for a seamless integration of user authentication features into your project.
