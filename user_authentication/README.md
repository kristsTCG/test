# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for authentication logic.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
  
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is responsible for handling user authentication logic. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes using Python. This file is essential for securing user accounts and managing access control within the application.

## Usage
1. To utilize the input validation functionalities, refer to the `validator.js` file. You can customize the validation rules according to your project requirements by modifying the functions within this file.

2. For user authentication tasks such as login, registration, and authentication, interact with the `auth.py` file. This file contains the necessary logic to authenticate users securely and manage user accounts effectively.

3. Ensure to integrate these files into your project's authentication flow to enhance security and user experience. Regularly update the validation rules and authentication logic to adapt to changing security needs.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric and underscore characters.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password and returns a descriptive level.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class into your code and call its static methods as needed for input validation.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** User authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class managing user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:** `hashlib`, `json`, `datetime`, `timedelta`, `typing`.
