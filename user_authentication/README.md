# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This module handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side validation and auth.py for server-side authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation logic for user inputs. It ensures that user-provided data meets specified criteria before submission.
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for server-side authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication against the system.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to suit the project requirements.
   - Include the `validator.js` file in the appropriate HTML pages to enable client-side validation.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Implement additional authentication logic as required by the project.
   - Integrate the authentication functionalities provided in `auth.py` with the rest of the project's backend components.

Ensure that both client-side and server-side validation work seamlessly to provide a secure and user-friendly authentication experience.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username allowing alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on various criteria.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the provided validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** User authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Register a new user with username, email, and password.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticate user and return a session token.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: End a user session.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication. Call `register_user` to register a new user, `login` to authenticate and get a session token, `logout` to end a session, and `is_authenticated` to check session validity.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: for hashing functions.
- `json`: for JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: for date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: for time duration calculations.
- `typing`: for type hints.
