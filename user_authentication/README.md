# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: Handles validation of user input for authentication purposes.
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Language: JavaScript

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Manages user authentication processes.
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Language: Python

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
- Use `validator.js` for validating user input before authentication.
- Utilize `auth.py` for managing user authentication processes.
- Ensure to understand the logic and flow within each file to effectively implement user authentication in the project.
