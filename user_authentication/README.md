# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized with two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python. These files handle user input validation and user authentication logic respectively.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This file contains functions for validating user input, ensuring that data entered by users meets specified criteria. It plays a crucial role in maintaining data integrity and security.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file is responsible for handling user authentication processes such as login, registration, and password management. It implements secure authentication mechanisms to protect user accounts.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions provided in `validator.js`, import the necessary functions into your JavaScript files and call them as needed to validate user input.
   
2. For user authentication functionalities, import `auth.py` into your Python scripts and utilize the defined functions for user login, registration, and password management. Ensure to follow best practices for secure authentication processes.

By following the guidelines outlined in the key files, developers can effectively implement user authentication features within the project.
