# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Language: JavaScript
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Role: This file handles the validation of user input for authentication purposes. It ensures that the data entered by the user meets the required criteria before proceeding with the authentication process.

2. **auth.py**
   - Language: Python
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Role: This file manages the authentication process for users. It includes functions for verifying user credentials, generating authentication tokens, and handling user sessions.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review `validator.js` to understand the validation criteria for user input.
2. Explore `auth.py` to familiarize yourself with the authentication process and functions available for user authentication.
3. Integrate these files into your project to enable user authentication functionality.
