# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes scripts for validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: Responsible for validating user input data.
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Language: JavaScript

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Manages user authentication processes.
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Language: Python

## Usage
1. **validator.js**
   - To use the `validator.js` script, import it into your JavaScript files using `import validator from './validator.js';`.
   - Call the appropriate validation functions from `validator.js` to validate user input data.

2. **auth.py**
   - To utilize the `auth.py` script, import it into your Python files using `import auth`.
   - Use the functions provided in `auth.py` to handle user authentication tasks within your Python application.

Ensure that you understand the specific functionalities of each file before integrating them into your project.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character requirements.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class in your code and call the validation functions as needed.

```javascript
const InputValidator = require('./validator.js');

if (InputValidator.validateEmail('example@email.com')) {
    console.log('Email is valid');
}

if (InputValidator.validatePassword('StrongPass123')) {
    console.log('Password meets requirements');
}

if (InputValidator.validateUsername('user_name123')) {
    console.log('Username is valid');
}

const passwordStrength = InputValidator.getPasswordStrength('SecurePass123');
console.log('Password strength:', passwordStrength);
```

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For time-based calculations.
- `typing`: For type hints.
