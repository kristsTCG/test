# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side input validation and auth.py for server-side authentication logic.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation functions to ensure that user input meets specified criteria before submission.
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for server-side authentication processes, such as verifying user credentials and managing user sessions.

## Usage
1. Use `validator.js` to implement client-side validation for user input forms by importing the necessary functions and integrating them into the frontend code.
2. Utilize `auth.py` to handle server-side authentication tasks, such as verifying user credentials during login attempts and managing user sessions securely. Ensure to integrate the authentication logic with the backend services as needed.
