# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication logic within the system.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Refer to `validator.js` for validating user input data before processing authentication requests.
2. Utilize `auth.py` for implementing user authentication features such as login, registration, and authentication logic in your project.

Ensure to integrate these files seamlessly into your project's authentication workflow for secure user authentication processes.
