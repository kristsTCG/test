# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This module handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side validation and auth.py for server-side authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation logic for user inputs. It ensures that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submitting to the server.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for server-side authentication. It manages user authentication processes, such as verifying user credentials and generating access tokens.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to match the project's requirements.
   - Include the `validator.js` file in the relevant HTML pages using `<script>` tags.
   - Call the validation functions from your form submission logic to validate user inputs.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Implement additional authentication logic as required by the project.
   - Integrate the authentication functionality with other parts of the project that require user authentication.
   - Ensure proper error handling and secure authentication practices are followed.

By following the guidelines above, you can effectively utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this folder.
