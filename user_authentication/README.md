# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for authentication logic.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that the data entered by users meets the required criteria.
   
2. **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication logic using Python.

## Usage
To utilize the functionality provided in this folder:
1. Use the functions defined in `validator.js` to validate user input before processing it further.
2. Incorporate the authentication logic from `auth.py` to handle user registration, login, and authentication within the project.
