## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side validation and auth.py for server-side authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation logic for user inputs. It ensures that user-provided data meets specified criteria before submission.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python file handles server-side authentication processes. It verifies user credentials, generates tokens, and manages user sessions.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify validation rules as needed by updating the logic in this file.
   - Include this script in your HTML files to enable client-side validation for user inputs.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Configure authentication settings such as token expiration and session management within this file.
   - Integrate the authentication logic into your server-side code to secure user access to protected resources.
