# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes validation logic in JavaScript and authentication logic in Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` for input validation and `auth.py` for user authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters of code responsible for validating user inputs. It ensures that the data entered by users meets the required criteria before processing.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python file consists of 2198 characters of code dedicated to user authentication. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the system.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation logic as needed to enforce specific input requirements.
   - Include the `validator.js` file in your project to validate user inputs effectively.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Implement the authentication methods provided in `auth.py` to handle user registration and login securely.
   - Customize the authentication logic to integrate with your project's user management system.

Ensure that both files are appropriately integrated into your project to enable secure and reliable user authentication functionalities.

- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username allowing alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class into your code and call the validation functions as needed.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
