# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` contains two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters that handles user input validation.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters that implements the authentication logic.

## Key Files
### validator.js
The `validator.js` file is responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the data entered by users meets the required criteria and is safe for processing.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file contains the authentication logic for verifying user credentials and managing user sessions. It handles user login, logout, and session management within the application.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules applied to user input.
2. Examine the `auth.py` file to understand how user authentication is implemented in the project.
3. Make necessary modifications to the validation rules or authentication logic as per project requirements.
4. Ensure that any changes made adhere to security best practices to protect user data and privacy.
