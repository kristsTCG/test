# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate the validation logic implemented in JavaScript from the authentication logic implemented in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains the logic for validating user inputs and ensuring they meet the required criteria. It plays a crucial role in ensuring data integrity and security.
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes, such as verifying user credentials and generating access tokens. It is an essential component for securing user access to the system.

## Usage
Developers can utilize the `validator.js` file to implement client-side validation for user inputs on forms. They can customize the validation rules according to the project requirements.

The `auth.py` file provides the necessary functions for authenticating users within the system. Developers can integrate these functions into the backend to secure user access and manage user sessions effectively.
