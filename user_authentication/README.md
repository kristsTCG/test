# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for authentication processes.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This file contains functions to validate user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that the user-provided information meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
   
2. `auth.py`: The `auth.py` file is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication logic using Python.

## Usage
To utilize the functionality provided in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules and functions available.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to grasp the authentication logic and processes implemented in Python.
3. Integrate these files into the project's authentication system as needed, ensuring proper error handling and security measures are in place.
