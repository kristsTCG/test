# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.

2. `auth.py`: With 2198 characters, `auth.py` is a Python file that manages the authentication logic for users. It handles user login, registration, and other authentication-related tasks within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in the `user_authentication` folder, developers can refer to the `validator.js` file for input validation requirements and utilize the `auth.py` file for implementing user authentication processes in the project. Make sure to follow the guidelines and logic defined in these files to ensure secure and reliable user authentication mechanisms.
