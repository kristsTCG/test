# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This functionality is responsible for validating user input and handling user authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` contains two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters that handles input validation for user authentication.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters that manages user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
The `validator.js` file is crucial for ensuring that user input for authentication is valid. It contains functions to validate user credentials, such as email addresses and passwords, before proceeding with authentication processes.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is essential for managing user authentication within the project. It handles processes such as user login, registration, and authentication token generation. This file plays a vital role in ensuring secure user authentication.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the input validation logic for user authentication.
2. Examine the `auth.py` file to understand how user authentication processes are managed within the project.
3. Modify and extend the functionality as needed to meet specific project requirements related to user authentication.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets certain criteria (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username meets certain criteria (3-20 characters, alphanumeric and underscores only).
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of the input password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to use the provided authentication functionalities.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For handling JSON data.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hinting.
