# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` for client-side validation in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This file contains client-side validation logic written in JavaScript. It ensures that user input meets specified criteria before submitting to the server for authentication.
   
2. `auth.py`: The `auth.py` file handles server-side authentication using Python. It verifies user credentials, generates tokens, and manages user sessions securely.

## Usage
1. To utilize client-side validation, refer to `validator.js` and integrate the validation logic into your front-end forms.
   
2. For server-side authentication, utilize `auth.py` to authenticate users, manage sessions, and secure access to protected resources within the project.

Ensure to follow best practices for user authentication and security when working with the code in this folder.
