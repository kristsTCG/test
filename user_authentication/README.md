# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains functions to validate user input for authentication purposes. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file contains authentication logic written in Python. It manages user authentication processes such as login, logout, and session management within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in the `user_authentication` folder, developers can refer to the `validator.js` file for input validation requirements and use the `auth.py` file to implement user authentication processes in the project. Ensure to integrate these files with other relevant components for a seamless user authentication experience.

**Usage:** This file can be imported as a module in Node.js applications using `const InputValidator = require('./validator.js');`.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with username, email, and password.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the session token.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to utilize user authentication functionalities like registration, login, logout, and session validation.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For time duration calculations.
- `typing`: For type hints.
