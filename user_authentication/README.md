# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user inputs and ensuring data integrity during the authentication process.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file contains 2198 characters and manages the authentication logic, including user login, registration, and session management.

## Usage
Developers can utilize the `validator.js` file to implement client-side input validation for user authentication forms. The `auth.py` file can be used to handle server-side authentication processes, such as verifying user credentials and managing user sessions. Ensure to integrate these files seamlessly into the project's authentication flow for secure user interactions.
