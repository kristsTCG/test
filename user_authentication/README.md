# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This folder is responsible for handling user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to include two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python. These files work together to provide validation and authentication capabilities for user accounts.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It includes functions for verifying user credentials and managing user sessions.

## Usage
To utilize the code in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation logic and criteria for user input data.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to familiarize yourself with the authentication processes and functions available.
3. Integrate the validation and authentication functionalities into your project by importing and utilizing the necessary functions from these files.
