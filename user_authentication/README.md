# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes files responsible for validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Language: JavaScript
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Role: Responsible for validating user input data for authentication processes.

2. **auth.py**
   - Language: Python
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Role: Manages the authentication logic and processes for user login and access control.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionalities in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules for user input data.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to grasp the authentication logic and processes implemented in Python.
3. Modify or extend the code as needed to integrate user authentication features into the project.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character requirements.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class in your code:
```javascript
const InputValidator = require('./validator.js');
```

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the provided session token.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For time duration calculations.
- `typing`: For type hints.
