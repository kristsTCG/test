# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file consists of 2198 characters and focuses on handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication functionalities.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication features in this folder:
1. Review and understand the code in `validator.js` for user input validation logic.
2. Explore the functionalities in `auth.py` to implement user authentication processes.
3. Integrate these files into your project to enable secure user authentication mechanisms.
