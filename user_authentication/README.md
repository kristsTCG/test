# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate the validation logic in `validator.js` written in JavaScript and the authentication logic in `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This file contains the validation logic for user inputs. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
- `auth.py`: This file handles the authentication process for users. It verifies user credentials and grants access based on the authentication rules defined within the project.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation logic, refer to `validator.js` and integrate the validation functions within the user input forms to ensure data integrity.
2. For user authentication, utilize the functions defined in `auth.py` to authenticate users based on the project's authentication requirements.
3. Ensure that both files are appropriately imported and called within the project to enable user authentication functionalities.
