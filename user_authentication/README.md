# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user data meets specified criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
  
- `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication logic. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the project.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review `validator.js` to understand the validation rules and functions applied to user input.
2. Explore `auth.py` to understand the authentication logic and processes implemented for user registration and login.
3. Ensure that any modifications or additions to these files align with the project's user authentication requirements.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file contains input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates that a password meets specific criteria (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username (3-20 characters, alphanumeric and underscores only).
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Assesses the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** This file can be imported into other JavaScript files using `require` or `import` statements, and its methods can be called as static functions of the `InputValidator` class.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user authentication operations.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token for active sessions.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by removing the session token from active sessions.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Import the `UserAuth` class to use the user authentication system in your application.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For handling JSON data.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints in function signatures.
