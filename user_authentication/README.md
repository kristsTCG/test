# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains code for validating user input and ensuring data integrity during the authentication process. It plays a crucial role in verifying user credentials.
   
2. `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` manages the authentication logic, including user login, registration, and session management. It interacts with the database to authenticate users securely.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionalities in this folder:
1. Review and understand the code in `validator.js` for input validation and data integrity checks.
2. Explore `auth.py` to understand the authentication logic and how user sessions are managed.
3. Integrate these files into the project's authentication system as needed, ensuring proper error handling and security measures are in place.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the session token.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to use the provided user authentication functionalities.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization and deserialization.
