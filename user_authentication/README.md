# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` for client-side input validation in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This file is responsible for client-side input validation. It contains functions to validate user input before submitting it to the server. With 1212 characters, it plays a crucial role in ensuring data integrity and security on the client side.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file handles server-side authentication processes. With 2198 characters, it manages user authentication, login, and authorization within the application. It interacts with the database and ensures secure access to user accounts.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed for different input fields.
   - Include this script in your HTML files to enable client-side validation.
   - Ensure that the validation logic aligns with the server-side validation to maintain data consistency.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Implement additional authentication logic as required by the project.
   - Securely store sensitive information such as passwords and tokens.
   - Integrate this file with other components that require user authentication, such as user profile management or access control.

By following the guidelines outlined in the key files, developers can effectively manage user authentication processes in the project.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file contains input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character requirements.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class where input validation is needed.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** User authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class managing user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates user and returns session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends user session.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if session is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:** hashlib, json, datetime, timedelta, typing
