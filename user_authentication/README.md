# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It ensures that user-provided data meets specified criteria before submission.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file handles server-side authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication using secure methods.

## Usage
1. To utilize the client-side validation functionality, refer to `validator.js`. Modify the validation criteria as needed to suit the project requirements.
   
2. For server-side authentication tasks, interact with `auth.py`. Implement the necessary endpoints and functions to manage user authentication securely.

Ensure to maintain consistency between client-side and server-side validation logic for a seamless user authentication experience.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates an email address based on a regular expression pattern.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates a password based on specific criteria (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates a username based on length and allowed characters.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Assesses the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class and call its static methods to perform input validation or password strength assessment.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session based on the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and the user is authenticated.

**Usage:** Import the `UserAuth` class from this file to handle user authentication in your Python application.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For handling JSON data.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
