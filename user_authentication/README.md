# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes scripts for validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. `auth.py`: The Python script `auth.py` is responsible for managing user authentication processes. It handles tasks such as user login, registration, and authentication verification.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Use the functions defined in `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing it for authentication.
2. Incorporate the authentication logic from `auth.py` into your project to enable user registration, login, and authentication features.

Ensure that you understand the functions and methods defined in each file to effectively implement user authentication in your project.
