# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This functionality is crucial for managing user access and security.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side validation and auth.py for server-side authentication logic.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file (1212 characters) handles client-side validation of user input for authentication purposes. It ensures that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submitting it to the server.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python file (2198 characters) contains server-side authentication logic. It manages user authentication processes, such as verifying credentials, generating tokens, and handling user sessions.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Include this file in your HTML pages using a script tag.
   - Use the functions provided in `validator.js` to validate user input before sending it to the server for authentication.
  
2. **auth.py**:
   - Integrate the functions from `auth.py` into your server-side codebase.
   - Utilize the authentication logic to authenticate users, manage sessions, and ensure secure access to protected resources.

Ensure that both client-side and server-side authentication processes are in sync to provide a seamless and secure user authentication experience.
