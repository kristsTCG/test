# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for authentication processes.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This file contains functions for validating user input, ensuring data integrity and security.
- `auth.py`: This file handles user authentication processes such as login, logout, and user session management.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code and call the necessary functions to validate user input.
2. For user authentication tasks, import `auth.py` into your Python code and use the provided functions to manage user authentication processes within the project.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class managing user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Register a new user with a unique username.
