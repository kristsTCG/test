# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication features efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side validation and auth.py for server-side authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation logic for user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring data integrity before submitting it to the server.
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for server-side authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication using secure protocols.

## Usage
To utilize the code in this folder effectively:
1. Use `validator.js` to implement client-side validation for user input forms.
2. Utilize `auth.py` to handle server-side authentication tasks such as user login and registration.
3. Ensure to integrate both files seamlessly to provide a secure and user-friendly authentication experience.
