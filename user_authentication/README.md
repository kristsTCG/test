## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the data provided by users meet the required criteria for authentication.

2. **auth.py**: This Python file contains 2198 characters and handles the authentication logic for users. It verifies user credentials and grants access based on the authentication process.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in the `user_authentication` folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation criteria for user input data.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to comprehend the authentication process and how user credentials are verified.
3. Integrate these files into your project to enable user authentication features.

Ensure to adhere to the validation rules set in `validator.js` and utilize the authentication logic in `auth.py` for secure user authentication in your project.
