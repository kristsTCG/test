# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` for client-side validation written in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication logic written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submission.
   
2. `auth.py`: This file handles server-side authentication tasks such as verifying user credentials, generating tokens, and managing user sessions. It is essential for securing user access to the application.

## Usage
1. To utilize the client-side validation provided by `validator.js`, include the script in your HTML file using `<script src="path/to/validator.js"></script>`. Then, call the validation functions as needed in your front-end code.

2. For server-side authentication tasks, import `auth.py` in your Python application using `import auth`. Utilize the functions defined in this file to authenticate users and manage their access to protected resources.
