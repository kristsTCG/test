# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It includes functions for user login, registration, and authentication checks.

## Usage
To utilize the functionality provided in this folder:
1. Review the code in `validator.js` to understand the validation rules applied to user input.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to understand the authentication logic and functions available for user authentication tasks.
3. Integrate these files into your project's authentication system as needed, ensuring to adhere to any specific requirements or guidelines outlined in the code.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is between 3 to 20 characters and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticate a user and return a session token.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: End a user's session based on the provided session token.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Check if a session token is valid and the user is authenticated.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization/deserialization.
- `datetime`: For date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
