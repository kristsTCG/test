# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input and ensuring data integrity during the authentication process.
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` handles user authentication logic, such as verifying user credentials and generating authentication tokens.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in the `user_authentication` folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file for validation functions and data integrity checks.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to understand the user authentication logic and token generation process.
3. Integrate these files into your project to enhance user authentication and security features.
