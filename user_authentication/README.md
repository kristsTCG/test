# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` for client-side validation written in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic with 1212 characters. It ensures that user input meets specified criteria before sending it to the server for authentication.
   
2. **auth.py**: With 2198 characters, `auth.py` is responsible for server-side authentication processes. It handles user login, registration, and authentication using Python.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this folder:
1. Modify the validation criteria in `validator.js` to suit your project's requirements.
2. Implement server-side authentication logic in `auth.py` according to your application's needs.
3. Ensure proper integration of these files with other components that require user authentication within the project.
