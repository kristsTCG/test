# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` contains two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters responsible for input validation.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file is crucial for validating user input within the authentication process. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is essential for handling user authentication within the project. It contains the logic for verifying user credentials and granting access to authorized users.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality, refer to the `validator.js` file and incorporate the validation methods into your user input forms.
2. For user authentication processes, interact with the `auth.py` file to authenticate users based on their credentials and manage access control within the project.
