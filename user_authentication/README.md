# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for authentication processes.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input, ensuring data integrity and security.
- **auth.py**: Responsible for handling user authentication processes, such as login, logout, and user session management.

## Usage
1. Utilize `validator.js` for validating user input by importing the necessary functions into your JavaScript files.
2. Incorporate `auth.py` in your Python scripts to implement user authentication features like login and session management.

Ensure to follow the documentation within each file for specific usage instructions and function details.
