# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for authentication logic.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user inputs such as email addresses, passwords, and other user data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.

2. **auth.py**: This Python file handles the authentication logic for verifying user credentials, generating tokens, and managing user sessions. It is responsible for securely authenticating users within the system.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
- Use the functions defined in `validator.js` to validate user inputs before processing authentication requests.
- Utilize the authentication logic implemented in `auth.py` to authenticate users securely and manage user sessions effectively.
- Ensure to follow the guidelines and best practices outlined in the code comments for seamless integration with the project's authentication system.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username allowing only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types, returning a descriptive level.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class in your code and call the validation functions as needed.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** User authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class managing user authentication operations.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Register a new user with username, email, and password.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticate user and return session token.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: End user session.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Check if session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to use user authentication functionalities.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON operations.
- `datetime`: For handling date and time.
- `timedelta`: For time calculations.
- `typing`: For type hints.
