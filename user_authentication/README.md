# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file is 2198 characters long and handles the authentication logic for users. It verifies user credentials and grants access based on authentication rules and procedures.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionality in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation criteria for user input.
2. Examine the `auth.py` file to understand the authentication logic and rules implemented.
3. Integrate these files into your project as needed to enable user authentication processes.

- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username allowing alphanumeric characters and underscores within a specific length range.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character complexity.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the provided validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py
