# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate the validation logic implemented in JavaScript and the authentication logic implemented in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains the validation logic for user inputs. It is crucial for ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication against stored credentials.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to match the project's requirements.
   - Include `validator.js` in the relevant parts of the project where user input validation is necessary.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Use the functions provided in `auth.py` for user registration, login, and authentication.
   - Ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed and configured for the Python environment.
   - Integrate the authentication functionalities into the project's user management system.

By following the guidelines in the key files, developers can effectively implement user authentication features within the project.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, logout, and session validation.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and hashed password.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session by removing the session token.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib` for hashing functions.
- `json` for JSON serialization.
- `datetime` for date and time operations.
- `timedelta` for time duration calculations.
- `typing.Optional` for type hinting.
