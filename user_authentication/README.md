## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized with two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file containing functions for validating user input. (1212 characters)
- `auth.py`: A Python file handling authentication logic. (2198 characters)

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file is crucial for validating user input to ensure data integrity and security.

### auth.py
This file is essential for handling user authentication processes, such as login, logout, and user session management.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code and call the necessary functions to validate user input.
2. For authentication functionalities, import `auth.py` into your Python code and utilize the provided functions for user authentication processes.

Ensure to follow the documentation within each file for specific usage instructions and parameters.
