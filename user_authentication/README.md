# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains code for validating user input, ensuring that the data provided meets the required criteria for authentication.
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` handles the authentication logic, including verifying user credentials and granting access to authorized users.

## Usage
Developers can utilize the `validator.js` file to implement robust input validation for user authentication forms. The `auth.py` file can be integrated into the project to manage user authentication processes securely. Ensure to follow the code structure and comments within each file for seamless integration and customization.
