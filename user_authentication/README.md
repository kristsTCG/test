# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes validation logic in JavaScript and authentication logic in Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` for input validation and `auth.py` for user authentication.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters of code responsible for validating user inputs. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.

2. **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file, written in Python and comprising 2198 characters, handles user authentication processes. It verifies user credentials and grants access based on the authentication logic implemented within.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
1. Review the code in `validator.js` to understand the input validation logic and make any necessary adjustments to suit your project requirements.
2. Examine the `auth.py` file to understand how user authentication is implemented and integrate it with your project's user management system.
3. Ensure that both files are appropriately linked and called within your project to enable seamless user authentication processes.
