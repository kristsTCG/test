# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It is responsible for validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` for client-side validation written in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication logic written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It ensures that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submission.
  
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file handles server-side authentication processes. It manages user authentication, login, and authorization within the application.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Modify the `validator.js` file to customize client-side validation rules as needed.
2. Update the `auth.py` file to enhance server-side authentication logic or integrate with external authentication services.
3. Ensure that both client-side and server-side authentication processes are in sync to provide a secure and seamless user experience.
