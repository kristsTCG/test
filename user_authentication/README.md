# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. This module is responsible for validating user input and handling user authentication using JavaScript and Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` for client-side input validation and `auth.py` for server-side authentication logic.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file (1212 characters) is responsible for validating user input on the client-side. It ensures that user input meets the required criteria before submitting it for authentication.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file (2198 characters) handles the server-side authentication process. It manages user login, registration, and authentication using secure methods to verify user identity.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
- Use `validator.js` for client-side input validation by including it in your HTML files and calling its functions to validate user input.
- Utilize `auth.py` for server-side authentication tasks by importing it into your Python scripts and calling its functions to handle user authentication processes.
