# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This module is responsible for validating user input and handling user authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder contains two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters, responsible for input validation.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters, responsible for user authentication logic.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file handles the validation of user input to ensure data integrity and security. It plays a crucial role in preventing malicious input and ensuring that only valid data is processed by the system.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file contains the core logic for user authentication within the project. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes. This file is essential for ensuring secure access to the system and protecting user data.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review `validator.js` to understand the input validation rules and customize them as needed.
2. Study `auth.py` to familiarize yourself with the user authentication logic and make any necessary modifications to fit the project requirements.
3. Ensure that both files are integrated correctly with other parts of the project that require user authentication functionality.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username, allowing alphanumeric characters and underscores only.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and generates a session token for active sessions.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the provided session token.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid and the user is authenticated.

**Usage:** This file can be imported and used to handle user authentication in Python applications.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For time duration calculations.
- `typing`: For type hints.
