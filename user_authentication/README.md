# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file, written in Python, handles the authentication logic for users. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the system.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions, refer to `validator.js` and integrate the necessary validation checks in your user input forms.
2. For user authentication processes, interact with the functions defined in `auth.py`. This file contains methods for user registration, login, and authentication.
3. Ensure that the authentication logic in `auth.py` aligns with the project's requirements and security standards.
