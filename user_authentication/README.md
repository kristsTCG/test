# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input related to authentication. It ensures that the data entered by users meets the required criteria.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python file is 2198 characters long and manages the authentication process for users. It handles tasks such as user login, registration, and authentication checks.

## Usage
To utilize the functionality provided in this folder:
1. Use the `validator.js` file to validate user input for authentication-related fields.
2. Implement the functions and methods defined in `auth.py` to manage user authentication processes within the project.
