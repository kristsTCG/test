# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It includes validation logic in JavaScript and authentication logic in Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks. It contains two key files, `validator.js` for input validation and `auth.py` for user authentication.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters of code responsible for validating user inputs for authentication processes.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file contains 2198 characters of code dedicated to handling user authentication tasks within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionalities in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the input validation logic.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to understand how user authentication is implemented in Python.
3. Integrate the validation and authentication logic into your project as needed.
4. Ensure to handle errors and exceptions appropriately when using these functionalities.
