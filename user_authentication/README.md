# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for authentication processes.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
   
2. **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication tasks. It includes functions for verifying user credentials and managing user sessions securely.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
- Use the `validator.js` file to validate user input before processing authentication requests.
- Incorporate the `auth.py` file to implement user authentication mechanisms in your project.
- Ensure to follow the defined functions and methods within each file for seamless integration with the user authentication system.
