# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate the validation logic in `validator.js` written in JavaScript and the authentication logic in `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains the logic for validating user input and ensuring data integrity. It plays a crucial role in verifying user information before proceeding with authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication using Python.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality, refer to `validator.js` and integrate the validation logic into your user input forms.
   
2. For user authentication processes, utilize `auth.py` to manage user login, registration, and authentication within your project.

3. Ensure to maintain the separation of concerns between validation and authentication logic for better code organization and maintainability.
