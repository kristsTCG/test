# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication logic using Python.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
1. Refer to `validator.js` for validating user input data. Modify or extend the validation functions as needed.
2. Use `auth.py` for implementing user authentication processes. Integrate the authentication logic into the project's user management system.

Ensure to maintain the integrity and security of user authentication procedures while working with the code in this folder.
