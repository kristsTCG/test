# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` contains two key files: `validator.js` and `auth.py`. These files handle user input validation and authentication processes, respectively.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
  
- `auth.py`: This Python file is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It includes functions for verifying user credentials and managing user sessions securely.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in the `user_authentication` folder:
1. Use the functions defined in `validator.js` to validate user input data before authentication.
2. Implement the authentication logic defined in `auth.py` to authenticate users securely within the project.
