# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for authentication logic.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
   
2. `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication tasks. It includes functions for user login, registration, and other authentication-related operations.

## Usage
To utilize the code in this folder effectively:
- Use `validator.js` functions to validate user input before processing authentication requests.
- Utilize the functions in `auth.py` for user login, registration, and other authentication tasks.
- Ensure to maintain the integrity of the authentication process by following the guidelines and logic defined in these files.
