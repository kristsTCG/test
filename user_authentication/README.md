2. **auth.py**
   - Language: Python
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Role: Implements authentication logic, such as user login, registration, and session management.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**
   - To use the validation functions provided in `validator.js`, import the module into your JavaScript files using `require` or `import` statements.
   - Call the appropriate validation functions with the user input data as parameters to validate the input.

2. **auth.py**
   - Import the `auth` module into your Python files to access the authentication functionalities.
