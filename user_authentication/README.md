# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file contains 2198 characters and handles the authentication process for users. It verifies user credentials and grants access based on the authentication rules defined within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided by the `user_authentication` folder, developers can refer to the `validator.js` and `auth.py` files. They can integrate these files into the project to implement user validation and authentication mechanisms effectively. Developers should follow the code structure and logic defined in these files to ensure proper user authentication within the project.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character requirements.

**Usage:** This file can be imported into other JavaScript files using `require` or `import` statements, and the provided validation functions can be called with the respective input values.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token if successful.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the provided session token.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid and the user is authenticated.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
