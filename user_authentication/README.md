# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file contains 2198 characters and handles the authentication logic for users. It verifies user credentials and manages the authentication process.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionalities in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules applied to user input data.
2. Examine the `auth.py` file to understand how user authentication is implemented and how user credentials are verified.
3. Integrate these files into your project to enable secure user authentication processes.
