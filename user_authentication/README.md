# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` and `auth.py`, which are responsible for validating user input and handling authentication logic, respectively.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file (1212 characters) is crucial for validating user input data. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file (2198 characters) manages the authentication functionalities within the project. It handles user login, registration, and authentication processes to ensure secure access to the system.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Modify the `validator.js` file to customize the validation rules for user input data.
2. Update the `auth.py` file to enhance or modify the authentication logic as needed.
3. Ensure that both files are integrated correctly within the project to maintain secure user authentication processes.
