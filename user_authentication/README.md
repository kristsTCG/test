# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` contains two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters that handles input validation for user authentication.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters responsible for authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
The `validator.js` file is crucial for ensuring that user input for authentication is valid and secure. It contains functions to validate email addresses, passwords, and other user input data.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is essential for handling user authentication processes in the project. It includes functions for user login, registration, password hashing, and token generation.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Use the functions in `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing it for authentication.
2. Utilize the functions in `auth.py` for user login, registration, and other authentication-related tasks.
3. Ensure that the authentication processes are secure and follow best practices to protect user data.
