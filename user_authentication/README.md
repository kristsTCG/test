# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes to ensure secure access to the system.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files, `validator.js` and `auth.py`, which are responsible for validating user input and handling authentication logic, respectively.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js** (JavaScript):
   - Role: This file contains functions for validating user input data, such as email addresses, passwords, and other user credentials.
   - Size: 1212 characters

2. **auth.py** (Python):
   - Role: The `auth.py` file manages user authentication processes, including login, logout, and session management.
   - Size: 2198 characters

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided by the `user_authentication` folder, follow these steps:
1. Use the functions defined in `validator.js` to validate user input data before processing.
2. Implement the authentication logic provided in `auth.py` to handle user login, logout, and session management within the project.
3. Ensure to integrate these files with other components of the project that require user authentication to maintain system security.
