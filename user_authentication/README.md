# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This module handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the data provided by users meet the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.

2. **auth.py**: This Python file consists of 2198 characters and focuses on user authentication functionalities. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the system.

## Usage
Developers can utilize the `validator.js` file to implement robust input validation mechanisms for user data. They can customize the validation rules based on project requirements.

The `auth.py` file can be used to integrate user authentication features into the project. Developers can leverage this file to handle user login, registration, and authentication securely.

Ensure to maintain the integrity of the codebase and follow best practices while working with the user authentication functionalities provided in this folder.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specified criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength level of a password based on length and character requirements.

**Usage:** This file can be imported into other JavaScript files using `require` or `import` statements to access the input validation functions.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies are required for this file.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Register a new user with a unique username.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticate user and return a session token.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: End a user session.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication within your application.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For calculating expiration time for user sessions.
- `typing`: For type hints (not used in this file).
