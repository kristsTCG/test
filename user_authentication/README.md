# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes validation logic in JavaScript and authentication logic in Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication processes. It contains two key files: `validator.js` for input validation and `auth.py` for user authentication.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains logic for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication within the system.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation logic, refer to `validator.js` for functions related to input validation. Modify or extend these functions as needed to suit the project's requirements.
   
2. For user authentication functionalities, interact with `auth.py`. Use the provided functions to manage user login, registration, and authentication processes within the project.

3. Ensure that both files are integrated into the project's authentication workflow to maintain secure and reliable user authentication mechanisms.
