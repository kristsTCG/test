# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It is responsible for handling user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication logic using both JavaScript and Python. The key components include a JavaScript file for validation (`validator.js`) and a Python file for authentication (`auth.py`).

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user input data. It ensures that the data provided by the user meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python file contains 2198 characters and handles the authentication process for users. It verifies user credentials and grants access based on the authentication rules defined within the file.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality, refer to the `validator.js` file. Modify the validation rules as needed to suit the project's requirements.
   
2. For user authentication, interact with the `auth.py` file. Implement any additional authentication logic or rules required for the project.

3. Ensure that both files are integrated correctly within the project to enable seamless user authentication processes.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric and underscore characters.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password and returns a descriptive level.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
- `hash_password()`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user()`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login()`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout()`: Method to end a user's session.
- `is_authenticated()`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to use the provided authentication functionalities.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON encoding and decoding.
- `datetime`: For handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
