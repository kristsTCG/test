# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains code for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that the data provided by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication logic. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the system.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality, refer to `validator.js` and incorporate the validation methods into your user input forms.
   
2. For user authentication processes, utilize `auth.py` to manage user login, registration, and authentication within your project.

3. Ensure to maintain the integrity of the authentication system by following the guidelines and best practices outlined in the respective files.
