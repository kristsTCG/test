# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input, ensuring data integrity and security.
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` manages user authentication processes, such as login, registration, and session management.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication features provided in this folder:
1. Modify the `validator.js` file to customize input validation rules as needed.
2. Implement the authentication logic in `auth.py` to handle user registration, login, and session management.
3. Ensure that both files are integrated into the project's authentication workflow for seamless user authentication.
