# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes files responsible for validating user input and handling user authentication using JavaScript and Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` for client-side validation using JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication using Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: Responsible for client-side validation of user input.
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Language: JavaScript

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Manages server-side authentication processes.
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Language: Python

## Usage
1. **validator.js**
   - To use the client-side validation functionality, include `validator.js` in your HTML file using a script tag.
   - Modify the validation rules and logic in `validator.js` as needed for your project.

2. **auth.py**
   - Ensure that `auth.py` is integrated into your server-side codebase to handle user authentication.
   - Customize the authentication logic in `auth.py` to suit your project's requirements.

By following the instructions provided for each file, you can effectively implement user authentication features in your project using the code in the `user_authentication` folder.
