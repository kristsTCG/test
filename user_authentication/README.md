# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python file handles the authentication process for users. It includes functions for user login, registration, and other authentication-related tasks.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code and call the necessary functions to validate user input data.
   
2. For user authentication tasks such as login and registration, import `auth.py` into your Python code and utilize the provided functions to authenticate users within the system.
