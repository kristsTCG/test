- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters, responsible for input validation.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters, handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Role**: Responsible for input validation.
- **Character Count**: 1212
- **Usage**: Ensures that user input meets specified criteria before processing.

### auth.py
- **Role**: Handles user authentication processes.
- **Character Count**: 2198
- **Usage**: Manages user authentication, including login, registration, and token generation.

## Usage
1. To utilize the input validation functionality, refer to `validator.js`. Modify the validation criteria as needed for your project requirements.
2. For user authentication processes, such as login and registration, refer to `auth.py`. Implement the necessary functions for user authentication in your project.

Ensure to maintain the integrity of user data and follow best practices for authentication and input validation.
