# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles validation and authentication processes for users accessing the system.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data, ensuring it meets specified criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.
- `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` manages user authentication logic, handling user login, registration, and session management within the system.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionalities in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules applied to user input data.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to comprehend the authentication logic implemented for user login, registration, and session management.
3. Integrate these files into the project's authentication workflow as needed, ensuring proper validation and authentication processes for user interactions.
