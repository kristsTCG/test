# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks. It contains two key files: `validator.js` for client-side input validation written in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication logic written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic to ensure that user input meets specified criteria before submission. It plays a crucial role in enhancing data integrity and user experience.
   
2. **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is responsible for server-side authentication processes. It manages user authentication, authorization, and session handling within the application.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
- Use `validator.js` to implement client-side input validation by including the necessary validation rules in your frontend code.
- Incorporate `auth.py` into your backend system to handle user authentication processes securely and efficiently. Ensure proper integration with your existing authentication mechanisms for a seamless user experience.

- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength and format of a password.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character requirements.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class where needed and call the relevant validation functions or password strength function.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
