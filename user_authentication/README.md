# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python file handles the authentication logic for users. It manages the process of verifying user credentials and granting access based on authentication rules.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - To use the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code.
   - Call the appropriate validation functions with user input data to ensure data integrity and security.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Import `auth.py` into your Python code to access the authentication functionalities.
   - Utilize the authentication logic provided in `auth.py` to authenticate users based on the defined rules and criteria.

Ensure that you follow the documentation within each file for specific usage instructions and guidelines.
