# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes a JavaScript file for validation logic and a Python file for handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to centralize all user authentication-related code. It follows a modular approach with separate files for different aspects of authentication.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters of code and is responsible for handling validation logic related to user inputs for authentication processes.
   
2. **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` consists of 2198 characters and is crucial for managing user authentication functionalities within the project.

## Usage
Developers can utilize the `validator.js` file to implement client-side validation for user inputs related to authentication. The `auth.py` file can be used to handle server-side authentication processes, such as user login, registration, and token management. Ensure to maintain consistency between client-side and server-side validation to enhance security and user experience.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is 3-20 characters long, alphanumeric, and contains underscores only.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the session token.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to use the provided authentication functionalities.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
