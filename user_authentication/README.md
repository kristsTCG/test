# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains the logic for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python file handles the authentication process for users. It manages user login, registration, and authentication tasks within the application.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review `validator.js` to understand the validation rules applied to user input.
2. Explore `auth.py` to grasp the authentication flow and functions available for user management.
3. Make necessary modifications or enhancements to suit the project's authentication requirements.
