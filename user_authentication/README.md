## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user inputs and ensuring data integrity during the authentication process.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python file contains 2198 characters and manages the authentication logic, including user login, registration, and session management.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionalities, refer to `validator.js` and integrate the validation methods into your user input forms.
   
2. For authentication tasks such as user login and registration, refer to `auth.py` and incorporate the authentication logic into your application's backend.

3. Ensure to handle errors and exceptions appropriately to provide a seamless user authentication experience.
