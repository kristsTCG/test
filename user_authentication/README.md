# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains the JavaScript code for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is written in Python and is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication tasks within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation criteria for user input data.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to understand how user authentication processes are implemented in Python.
3. Integrate these files into your project to enable user authentication features.
4. Ensure to customize the authentication logic as per your project requirements.

By following these steps, you can effectively leverage the user authentication capabilities offered by the code in this folder.
