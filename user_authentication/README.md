# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` for client-side input validation in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication logic in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation functions written in JavaScript. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user input meets the required criteria before submission.
  
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is responsible for handling server-side authentication processes using Python. It manages user authentication, login, and authorization within the application.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify or add validation functions as needed to suit the project's requirements.
   - Include the `validator.js` file in your HTML templates using `<script>` tags.
   - Call the validation functions on user input fields to validate data before submission.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Implement additional authentication logic or customize existing functions to align with the project's authentication requirements.
   - Integrate the authentication functionalities provided in `auth.py` with your application's backend logic.
   - Ensure proper error handling and secure authentication practices are in place to protect user data.

By following the guidelines outlined in the key files, developers can effectively manage user authentication processes within the project.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the specified criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username meets the specified criteria.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of the input password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file provides a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, logout, and session validation.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash passwords using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token for active sessions.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by removing the session token from active sessions.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Import the `UserAuth` class from this file to implement user authentication in your Python application.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: for hashing passwords.
- `json`: for handling JSON data.
- `datetime`: for working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: for calculating time differences.
- `typing`: for type hints in function definitions.
