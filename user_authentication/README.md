# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling the authentication process. It manages user login, registration, and authentication tasks within the system.

## Usage
To utilize the functionality provided in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file for validation functions and ensure they are integrated into the user input forms.
2. Utilize the `auth.py` file to manage user authentication processes such as login, registration, and authentication within the project.
3. Ensure that both files are properly imported and utilized in the relevant parts of the project to enable secure user authentication.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on various criteria.

**Usage:** This file can be imported into other JavaScript files using `require` or `import` statements, and the functions can be called with appropriate parameters for input validation.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies and can be used independently for input validation tasks.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session by invalidating the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and the user is authenticated.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: for hashing passwords.
- `json`: for JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: for working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: for calculating time differences.
- `typing`: for type hints (not used in this file).
