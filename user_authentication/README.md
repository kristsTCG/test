# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains code for validating user input and ensuring data integrity during the authentication process.
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` manages user authentication logic, such as login, logout, and session management.

## Usage
Developers can utilize the `validator.js` file to implement client-side input validation for user authentication forms. The `auth.py` file provides server-side authentication functionality, enabling secure user login and session management within the project. Ensure to integrate these files appropriately with other components of the project for seamless user authentication processes.
