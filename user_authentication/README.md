# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate the validation logic in `validator.js` written in JavaScript and the authentication logic in `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This file contains the validation logic for user input. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
   
2. **auth.py**: This file handles the authentication process for users. It verifies user credentials and grants access based on the authentication rules implemented.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality, refer to `validator.js` and integrate the validation methods into the user input forms.
   
2. For user authentication, utilize `auth.py` to authenticate users based on the defined authentication rules and grant access accordingly.

Ensure that the validation and authentication processes are integrated seamlessly within the project to provide a secure user authentication experience.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username inputs, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of being at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and a number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is between 3 to 20 characters long and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on its length and character types.

**Usage:** This file can be imported into other JavaScript files using `require` or `import` statements to access the input validation functionalities provided by the `InputValidator` class.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For working with JSON data.
- `datetime`: For handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints in function definitions.
