# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**:
   - Language: JavaScript
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Role: Responsible for validating user input data for authentication purposes. Contains functions to ensure data integrity and security.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Language: Python
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Role: Implements the authentication logic for users. Manages user sessions, login, and logout functionalities.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions provided in `validator.js`, import the necessary functions into your JavaScript files using `import` or `require` statements.
   
   Example:
   ```javascript
   import { validateUsername, validatePassword } from './validator.js';
   ```

2. For the authentication functionalities implemented in `auth.py`, ensure the file is properly imported into your Python scripts.

   Example:
   ```python
   from user_authentication.auth import login, logout
   ```

3. Follow the documentation within each file to understand the specific functions and methods available for user authentication and validation.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the session token.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.
