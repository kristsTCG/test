# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This module handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side validation and auth.py for server-side authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It ensures that user-provided data meets specified criteria before submission.
- **auth.py**: This Python file manages server-side authentication processes. It handles user login, registration, and authentication against stored credentials.

## Usage
1. To utilize the client-side validation functionality, refer to `validator.js`. Update validation rules as needed to match project requirements.
2. For server-side authentication tasks, interact with `auth.py`. Implement additional authentication logic or integrate with existing user management systems as necessary.
