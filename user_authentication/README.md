# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains JavaScript code for validating user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided data meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file contains Python code responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication logic within the project.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality, refer to `validator.js` and incorporate the validation methods into your codebase.
2. For user authentication tasks, interact with the functions and logic defined in `auth.py`. This file provides the necessary tools to manage user authentication processes effectively.

- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength level of a password based on length and character requirements.

**Usage:** This file can be imported as a module to perform input validation tasks in user authentication workflows.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user authentication operations.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session using the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: for hashing functions.
- `json`: for JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: for date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: for time duration calculations.
- `typing`: for type hinting support.
