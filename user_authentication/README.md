- `auth.py`: A Python file responsible for user authentication logic.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- Role: Handles user input validation.
- Size: 1212 characters
- Language: JavaScript

### auth.py
- Role: Manages user authentication processes.
- Size: 2198 characters
- Language: Python

## Usage
1. To utilize the user input validation functions, refer to `validator.js`. Import the necessary functions into your JavaScript files and call them as needed.
2. For user authentication tasks, interact with `auth.py`. Import the authentication logic into your Python scripts to authenticate users securely.
