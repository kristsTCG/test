# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` for validation logic written in JavaScript and `auth.py` for authentication logic written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: Handles validation of user input.
   - Language: JavaScript
   - Size: 1212 characters

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Manages user authentication processes.
   - Language: Python
   - Size: 2198 characters

## Usage
1. **validator.js**
   - To use the validation logic in `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code.
   - Call the appropriate validation functions provided in `validator.js` to validate user input before processing.

2. **auth.py**
   - Import `auth.py` into your Python code to utilize the authentication functionalities.
   - Use the functions defined in `auth.py` to authenticate users and manage user sessions securely.

Ensure proper integration of these files into your project to enhance user authentication and security features.
