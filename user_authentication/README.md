# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` consists of two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file containing functions for validating user input. It is 1212 characters long.
- `auth.py`: A Python file that handles user authentication logic. It is 2198 characters long.

## Key Files
### validator.js
The `validator.js` file is crucial for ensuring that user input meets specified criteria. It contains functions for validating data such as email addresses, passwords, and other user-related information.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is responsible for managing user authentication processes. It includes functions for user login, registration, and authentication checks.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in the `user_authentication` folder, follow these steps:
1. Include the necessary files in your project.
2. Use the functions defined in `validator.js` to validate user input before processing.
3. Implement the authentication logic provided in `auth.py` to handle user registration, login, and authentication processes.

Ensure that you understand the functions and methods defined in each file to effectively incorporate user authentication features into your project.

- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length and character requirements.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username allowing only alphanumeric characters and underscores within a specific length range.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character complexity.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.
