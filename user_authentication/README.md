# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It includes files responsible for validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data related to authentication. It plays a crucial role in ensuring the integrity and security of user-provided information.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication tasks within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder, developers can integrate the validation functions from `validator.js` into their frontend code to ensure data integrity. They can also incorporate the authentication logic from `auth.py` into the backend to manage user authentication processes effectively. Make sure to follow the documentation and comments within the files for seamless integration and usage.
