## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: Responsible for validating user input data.
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Language: JavaScript

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Manages user authentication processes.
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Language: Python

## Usage
1. **validator.js**
   - To utilize the validation functionalities, import the `validator.js` file into your JavaScript code.
   - Use the exported functions to validate user input data before processing.

2. **auth.py**
