- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters responsible for user input validation.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters that manage user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- Role: Handles user input validation.
- Size: 1212 characters
- Language: JavaScript

### auth.py
- Role: Manages user authentication processes.
- Size: 2198 characters
- Language: Python

## Usage
1. To work with user input validation, refer to `validator.js`. Modify the validation rules as needed.
2. For user authentication processes, utilize `auth.py`. Implement login, logout, and user authentication functionalities using the provided methods.

Ensure to maintain the integrity of user authentication processes and follow best practices for secure authentication mechanisms.

- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username allowing alphanumeric characters and underscores within a specific length range.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character complexity.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class from `validator.js` and call the desired validation functions or password strength assessment function.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.

- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: End a user's session by invalidating the session token.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Check if a session token is valid and the user is authenticated.

**Usage:** Import the `UserAuth` class from this file to manage user authentication in your application.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For handling JSON data.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
