# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` consists of two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters, responsible for validating user input data.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters, handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
The `validator.js` file is crucial for ensuring the validity of user input data. It contains functions that validate user inputs such as email addresses, passwords, and other relevant data.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is essential for user authentication within the project. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes using Python.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionalities, refer to the `validator.js` file and import the necessary functions into your code.
2. For user authentication processes, make use of the functions defined in the `auth.py` file. Ensure proper integration with other parts of the project that require user authentication.

Ensure that any modifications or additions to the user authentication functionalities are properly tested to maintain the security and integrity of the system.
