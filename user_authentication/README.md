# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files: `validator.js` for client-side input validation written in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication logic written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: Responsible for client-side input validation.
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Language: JavaScript

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Handles server-side authentication logic.
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Language: Python

## Usage
1. **validator.js**
   - Ensure the file is linked in the appropriate HTML files where user input validation is required.
   - Modify validation rules as needed based on project requirements.
   - Test the validation logic thoroughly to ensure it functions correctly.

2. **auth.py**
   - Integrate the authentication logic into the server-side codebase where user authentication is needed.
   - Customize the authentication process based on the project's security requirements.
   - Test the authentication flow to verify its effectiveness and security measures.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username inputs, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates password complexity requirements.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash passwords using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session based on the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and the user is authenticated.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication processes. Call the methods within the class to register users, authenticate logins, manage sessions, and check authentication status.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: for hashing passwords.
- `json`: for JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: for working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: for calculating time differences.
- `typing`: for type hints (not used in this file).
