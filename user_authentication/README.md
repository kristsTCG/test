# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It is responsible for validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes `validator.js` for client-side validation in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It ensures that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submitting it for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is crucial for server-side authentication. It manages user authentication processes, such as verifying credentials, generating tokens, and authorizing access to protected resources.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to suit the project's requirements.
   - Include the `validator.js` file in your HTML templates using `<script>` tags.
   - Call the validation functions from your form submission logic to validate user input before sending it to the server.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Implement additional authentication methods or customize the existing ones to enhance security.
   - Integrate the authentication logic with your backend server to handle user login, registration, and access control.
   - Securely store sensitive information such as passwords and tokens to prevent unauthorized access.

Ensure that both client-side and server-side authentication mechanisms work seamlessly together to provide a secure and user-friendly authentication experience.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric and underscores within a specific length range.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength level of a password based on various criteria.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class where input validation is needed.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username, email, and hashed password.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user with username and password, returning a session token if successful.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session based on the provided session token.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid and the user is authenticated.

**Usage:** To use this file, create an instance of the `UserAuth` class and call its methods for user registration, login, logout, and authentication.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in the provided code snippet).
- `datetime`: For handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For calculating expiration time for user sessions.
- `typing`: For type hinting in function definitions.
