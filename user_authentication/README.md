# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes validation logic in JavaScript and authentication logic in Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication processes. The key components include a validator script in JavaScript and an authentication module in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains validation logic for user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication tasks within the system.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation logic, refer to `validator.js` and incorporate the necessary validation checks in your user input forms.
2. For authentication tasks, interact with the `auth.py` module to manage user login, registration, and authentication functionalities within the project.
