# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It includes a JavaScript file for validation logic and a Python file for handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files, `validator.js` for client-side validation and `auth.py` for server-side authentication.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring data integrity and security on the front end.
   
2. `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for server-side authentication processes. It manages user authentication, login, and authorization within the application.

## Usage
Developers can utilize the `validator.js` file to implement client-side validation for user input forms. This helps in validating user data before submitting it to the server, enhancing the overall security of the application.

The `auth.py` file can be used to integrate user authentication functionalities on the server-side. Developers can leverage this file to handle user login, registration, and authorization processes securely within the application.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates an email address based on a regular expression pattern.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates a password based on specific criteria (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates a username based on length and character restrictions.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** User authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
- `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Method to register a new user.
- `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Method to authenticate a user and return a session token.
- `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Method to end a user session.
- `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Method to check if a session is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For handling date and time.
- `timedelta`: For time-based calculations.
- `typing`: For type hints.
