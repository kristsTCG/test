# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains code for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication tasks within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided by the `user_authentication` folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the code in `validator.js` to understand the validation criteria for user input data.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to familiarize yourself with the user authentication processes implemented in Python.
3. Integrate the validation and authentication logic from these files into your project as needed.
4. Ensure to maintain the integrity and security of user authentication processes while customizing them for your specific requirements.
