# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate the validation logic implemented in JavaScript and the authentication logic implemented in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains the user validation logic, consisting of 1212 characters. It is responsible for validating user input data.
- `auth.py`: This Python file contains the user authentication logic, consisting of 2198 characters. It handles user authentication processes, such as login and logout functionalities.

## Usage
1. To work with the user validation logic, refer to `validator.js`. Modify the validation rules as needed to ensure secure user input handling.
2. For user authentication processes, utilize `auth.py`. Implement login and logout functionalities based on the project requirements.
3. Ensure to maintain the integrity of the authentication and validation processes to enhance the security of user interactions within the project.
