# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` for client-side input validation in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication logic in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation functions to ensure that user input meets specified criteria before submission.
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` manages server-side authentication processes, such as verifying user credentials and generating access tokens.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation functions as needed to enforce specific input requirements on the client-side.
   - Include the `validator.js` file in your HTML templates using `<script>` tags to enable client-side validation.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Implement additional authentication logic as required for your project.
   - Ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed to support the functionality defined in `auth.py`.
   - Integrate the authentication logic into your server-side codebase to secure user access and manage authentication processes.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the specified criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username meets the specified criteria.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of the input password based on length and character requirements.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the provided validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies required for using the functions provided in this file.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password()`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user()`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login()`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout()`: Method to end a user's session by invalidating the session token.
- `is_authenticated()`: Method to check if a session token is valid and the user is authenticated.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class and use its methods to register users, login, logout, and check authentication status.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints.
