# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate validation logic in `validator.js` (JavaScript) and authentication logic in `auth.py` (Python). Each file serves a specific purpose in the user authentication flow.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This file contains the validation logic for user input. It ensures that user-provided data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
- `auth.py`: This file handles the authentication process for users. It verifies user credentials and grants access based on the authentication flow implemented in the project.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to match the project's requirements.
   - Import and use the validation functions in other parts of the project where user input needs to be validated.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Implement additional authentication methods or strategies as required by the project.
   - Integrate the authentication logic with other parts of the project that require user authentication.

Ensure that both files are properly integrated into the project's overall authentication flow to maintain security and user data integrity.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the specified criteria (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number).
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username meets the specified criteria (3-20 characters, alphanumeric and underscores only).
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of the input password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and return a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session based on the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and the user is authenticated.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations like registration, login, logout, and session validation.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions like SHA-256 and MD5.
- `json`: For JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
