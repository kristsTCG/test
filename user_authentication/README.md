# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user inputs and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user inputs to ensure they meet the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file is 2198 characters long and handles the authentication processes for users, such as login, logout, and session management.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionality in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules applied to user inputs.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to familiarize yourself with the authentication logic implemented in Python.
3. Integrate these files into your project as needed for user authentication purposes.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file contains input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of being at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and a number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is 3-20 characters long and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of the input password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in other parts of the application.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password()`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user()`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login()`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout()`: Method to end a user session based on the session token.
- `is_authenticated()`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints (not used in this file).
