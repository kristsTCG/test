# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes validation logic in JavaScript and authentication logic in Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` for input validation and `auth.py` for user authentication.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters of code responsible for validating user inputs. It ensures that the data entered by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.

2. `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` consists of 2198 characters of code dedicated to user authentication. It manages the authentication process, including verifying user credentials and granting access to authorized users.

## Usage
To utilize the code in this folder effectively:
1. Review `validator.js` to understand the input validation logic and make any necessary adjustments to suit project requirements.
2. Explore `auth.py` to grasp the user authentication flow and customize it as needed for the project.
3. Integrate the provided validation and authentication functionalities into the project's user management system for secure user authentication processes.
