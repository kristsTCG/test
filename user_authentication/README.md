# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It consists of two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication logic within the system.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionality provided in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file for validation functions and customize them as needed for your project.
2. Study the `auth.py` file to understand the authentication logic implemented and integrate it with your application's user management system.
3. Ensure that both files are appropriately linked and called within your project to enable seamless user authentication processes.
