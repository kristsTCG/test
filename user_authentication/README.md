# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input data related to authentication. It ensures that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- `auth.py`: This Python file is 2198 characters long and handles the authentication logic for users. It verifies user credentials and manages the authentication process within the system.

## Usage
To utilize the functionality provided in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules for user input data.
2. Examine the `auth.py` file to understand how user authentication is implemented in the project.
3. Integrate these files into the project's authentication workflow as needed.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file contains input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username for alphanumeric characters and underscores within a specific length range.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file provides a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user authentication, registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by invalidating the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints (not used in this file).
