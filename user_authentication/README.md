# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input related to authentication processes. It ensures that user-provided data meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python file is 2198 characters long and handles the authentication logic for users. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the project.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation criteria for user input.
2. Examine the `auth.py` file to understand the authentication logic and processes implemented in Python.
3. Make necessary modifications or additions to these files to customize user authentication functionalities as per project requirements.

- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength level of a password based on various criteria.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the provided validation methods in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user authentication operations.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session by invalidating the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is still valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For handling JSON data.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
