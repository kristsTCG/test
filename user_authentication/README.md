# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle validation and authentication processes for users accessing the system.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Type: JavaScript
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Description: This file contains functions for validating user inputs and ensuring data integrity before proceeding with authentication processes.

2. **auth.py**
   - Type: Python
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Description: The `auth.py` file manages user authentication logic, including login, registration, and session management. It interacts with the database to verify user credentials and maintain user sessions securely.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions provided in `validator.js`, import the necessary functions into your JavaScript files and call them as needed to validate user inputs.
   
2. For user authentication tasks such as login and registration, interact with the functions defined in `auth.py` within your Python scripts. Ensure proper error handling and session management to maintain secure user authentication processes.
