# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. This module handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes validator.js for client-side validation and auth.py for server-side authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation logic for user inputs. It ensures that user-provided data meets the required criteria before submission.
- **auth.py**: This Python file is responsible for server-side authentication processes. It manages user login, registration, and authentication using secure methods.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to match the project's requirements.
   - Include the script in your HTML files to enable client-side validation.
   
2. **auth.py**:
   - Configure the authentication settings such as database connections and encryption methods.
   - Integrate the authentication functions into your server-side code to handle user authentication processes.

Ensure to maintain the integrity and security of user authentication data throughout the project.
