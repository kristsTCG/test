# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes validation logic in JavaScript and authentication logic in Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication processes. It includes two key files: `validator.js` for input validation and `auth.py` for user authentication.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains logic for validating user inputs to ensure data integrity and security.
- `auth.py`: This Python file handles user authentication processes, such as login, logout, and session management.

## Usage
To utilize the code in this folder:
1. Use `validator.js` to validate user inputs before processing them.
2. Incorporate `auth.py` to manage user authentication functionalities in the project.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as a function to determine the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username, allowing alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on various criteria.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Hashes a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Registers a new user with a unique username.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Ends a user session.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Checks if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For working with JSON data.
- `datetime`: For handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
