# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file is 1212 characters long and is responsible for validating user input data related to authentication. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria for authentication.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file is 2198 characters long and manages the authentication process for users. It handles user login, registration, and other authentication-related tasks.

## Usage
To utilize the functionality provided in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation criteria for user input data.
2. Examine the `auth.py` file to understand how user authentication processes are handled in the project.
3. Implement the necessary calls to these files in your project to enable user authentication features.
