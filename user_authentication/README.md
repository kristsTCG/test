# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This file contains functions to validate user input for authentication purposes. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user data is correctly formatted and secure.
   
2. `auth.py`: This Python file handles the authentication logic for users. It manages user login, registration, and authentication processes within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionalities in this folder:
1. Use the functions defined in `validator.js` to validate user input before processing.
2. Incorporate the authentication logic from `auth.py` to manage user authentication processes such as login and registration.
