# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This module handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to encapsulate all the necessary components for user authentication. It includes validator.js for client-side validation written in JavaScript and auth.py for server-side authentication written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user data is correctly formatted before submission.
   
2. **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for server-side authentication processes. It manages user authentication, login, and session handling within the application.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this folder:
1. Modify `validator.js` to customize client-side validation rules as per project requirements.
2. Implement server-side authentication logic in `auth.py` to authenticate users and manage sessions securely.
3. Ensure proper integration of these files within the project's authentication flow to enhance user security and experience.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username inputs, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric and underscore characters.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength level of a password based on various criteria.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the provided validation methods in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session by invalidating the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations. Call methods like `register_user`, `login`, `logout`, and `is_authenticated` as needed.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints (not used in this file).
