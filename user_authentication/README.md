# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle validation and authentication processes for user accounts.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate the validation logic implemented in `validator.js` (JavaScript) and the authentication functionality in `auth.py` (Python).

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This file contains the JavaScript code for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
- `auth.py`: The `auth.py` file houses the Python code responsible for authenticating users. It manages the login and authentication processes, ensuring secure access to user accounts.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation capabilities, refer to `validator.js` and integrate the validation functions into your user input forms.
2. For user authentication features, utilize `auth.py` to handle user login, authentication, and session management within your project.
3. Ensure to maintain the integrity and security of user data by following best practices outlined in the respective files.
