# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
- `auth.py`: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling the authentication process. It manages user login, registration, and authentication tasks within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionality provided in this folder, developers can refer to the `validator.js` file for input validation requirements and use the `auth.py` file for implementing user authentication processes. Ensure that the functions and methods within these files are integrated correctly with other parts of the project that require user authentication.
