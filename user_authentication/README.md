# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript for input validation and `auth.py` written in Python for authentication logic.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: Responsible for validating user input data.
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Language: JavaScript

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Manages user authentication processes.
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Language: Python

## Usage
1. **validator.js**
   - To use the validation functions provided in `validator.js`, import the module into your JavaScript file:
     ```javascript
     const validator = require('./validator.js');
     ```
   - Call the validation functions as needed, passing the user input data:
     ```javascript
     if (validator.isValidEmail(email)) {
         // Proceed with the email validation logic
     }
     ```

2. **auth.py**
   - To utilize the authentication functionalities in `auth.py`, import the module in your Python script:
     ```python
     import auth
     ```
   - Use the authentication functions provided to authenticate users and manage user sessions:
     ```python
     if auth.authenticate_user(username, password):
         # User authentication successful
     ```

Ensure to follow the specific usage instructions within each file for seamless integration and functionality within the user authentication module.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining the strength of a password.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address using a regular expression.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numeric characters.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username, allowing only alphanumeric characters and underscores within a specific length range.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types, returning a descriptive strength level.

**Usage:** This file can be imported as a module in other JavaScript files to perform input validation tasks related to user authentication.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies are required for this file.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, session handling, and authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with username and password, generating a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session by invalidating the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in this file.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing password using SHA-256.
- `json`: For handling JSON data.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
