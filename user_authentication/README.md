# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling the authentication process. It includes functions for user login, registration, and authentication checks.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules and functions available.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to implement user authentication features such as login, registration, and authentication checks.
3. Ensure to integrate these files into the project's authentication workflow as needed.
