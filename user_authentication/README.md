# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It implements the logic for verifying user credentials and managing user sessions.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules and functions available.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to grasp the authentication logic and session management implemented.
3. Integrate these files into your project to enable secure user authentication processes.

- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on various criteria.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class from `validator.js` and call the desired validation functions or password strength function.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, logout, and session authentication.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
