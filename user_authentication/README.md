# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to separate the validation logic in `validator.js` written in JavaScript and the authentication logic in `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This file contains the validation logic for user inputs. It ensures that the data provided by users meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.
- `auth.py`: This file handles the authentication process for users. It verifies user credentials and grants access based on the authentication rules defined in the project.

## Usage
1. To work with the validation logic, refer to `validator.js`. You can customize the validation rules or add new ones to suit the project requirements.
2. For user authentication, utilize `auth.py`. Implement additional authentication methods or integrate with existing systems as needed.

Ensure that any modifications or additions to these files adhere to the project's authentication guidelines and security standards.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is 3-20 characters long and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of the input password based on length and character complexity.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication, registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by invalidating the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** This file can be imported into other Python scripts to handle user authentication processes.

**Dependencies:** 
- `hashlib`: for hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: for working with JSON data.
- `datetime`: for handling date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: for calculating time differences.
- `typing`: for type hints and annotations.
