# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This module is responsible for validating user input and managing user authentication using both JavaScript and Python.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` contains two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters that handles user input validation.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters that manages user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
The `validator.js` file is crucial for validating user input within the authentication process. It ensures that user-provided data meets the required criteria and format before proceeding with authentication.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is essential for managing user authentication in the project. It handles user login, registration, and authentication processes using Python.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided by the `user_authentication` module, follow these steps:
1. Use the `validator.js` file to validate user input before processing authentication requests.
2. Utilize the `auth.py` file to manage user authentication processes, including login, registration, and authentication.

Ensure that you understand the logic and flow within each file to effectively integrate user authentication functionalities into the project.
