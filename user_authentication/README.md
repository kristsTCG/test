# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities in the project. It includes validation logic in JavaScript and authentication logic in Python.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks. It contains two key files: `validator.js` for input validation and `auth.py` for user authentication.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains input validation logic for user authentication data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user input meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: This Python file handles user authentication processes. It includes functions for user login, registration, and authentication checks. This file is essential for managing user access to the system.

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed to match the project's requirements.
   - Include `validator.js` in the relevant scripts that handle user input validation.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Use the functions provided in `auth.py` for user login, registration, and authentication.
   - Ensure that the necessary configurations, such as database connections, are set up correctly.
   - Integrate `auth.py` with other parts of the project that require user authentication.

By following the guidelines above, developers can effectively utilize the user authentication functionalities provided in the `user_authentication` folder.
