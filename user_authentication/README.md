- Role: Handles validation of user input data.
- Size: 1212 characters
- Language: JavaScript

### auth.py
- Role: Implements user authentication logic.
- Size: 2198 characters
- Language: Python

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the necessary functions into your JavaScript files and call them as needed.
2. For user authentication logic, import the `auth.py` module into your Python code and use the provided functions for user authentication processes.
