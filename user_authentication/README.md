## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Type: JavaScript
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Role: Responsible for validating user input data related to authentication processes. This file ensures that the input data meets the required criteria for authentication.

2. **auth.py**
   - Type: Python
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Role: Manages the authentication processes for users. This file handles user login, registration, and authentication tasks using Python.

## Usage
