# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user inputs and ensuring data integrity during the authentication process.
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication logic, such as verifying user credentials and generating access tokens.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions, refer to `validator.js` and integrate them into your user input forms to ensure data consistency.
2. For user authentication tasks, interact with `auth.py` to authenticate users, manage sessions, and authorize access within the system.

- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and number requirements.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username, allowing alphanumeric characters and underscores only.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Determines the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import the `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** None.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** User authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class managing user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with username and password, returning a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user session by invalidating the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid.

**Usage:** Instantiate `UserAuth` to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:**
