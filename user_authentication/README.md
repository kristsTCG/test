# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This file contains client-side validation logic for user input. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user data meets the required criteria before submission.
  
- **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is responsible for server-side authentication processes. It manages user authentication, login, and access control within the application.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder:
1. Review `validator.js` to understand the client-side validation rules and make any necessary adjustments.
2. Examine `auth.py` to understand the server-side authentication logic and customize it as needed.
3. Ensure that both client-side and server-side validation processes are synchronized to provide a seamless user authentication experience.

# Files Documentation

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username with alphanumeric and underscore characters.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password and returns a level of strength.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class where input validation is needed.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file contains a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class to manage user authentication operations.
  - `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
  - `register_user(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> bool`: Method to register a new user.
  - `login(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[str]`: Method to authenticate a user and return a session token.
  - `logout(session_token: str) -> bool`: Method to end a user session.
  - `is_authenticated(session_token: str) -> bool`: Method to check if a session is valid.

**Usage:** 
1. Create an instance of `UserAuth` to manage user authentication.
2. Call `register_user` to register a new user with a username, email, and password.
3. Call `login` with username and password to authenticate and receive a session token.
4. Use the session token for subsequent authenticated operations.
5. Call `logout` to end a user session.
6. Use `is_authenticated` to check if a session token is valid.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing functions.
- `json`: For JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: For date and time operations.
- `timedelta`: For time duration calculations.
- `typing`: For type hints.
