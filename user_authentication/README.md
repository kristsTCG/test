# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` for client-side validation written in JavaScript and `auth.py` for server-side authentication written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Role: Handles client-side validation of user input.
   - Language: JavaScript
   - Size: 1212 characters

2. **auth.py**
   - Role: Manages server-side authentication processes.
   - Language: Python
   - Size: 2198 characters

## Usage
1. **validator.js**
   - This file is responsible for validating user input on the client-side.
   - Developers can modify the validation rules as needed by updating the functions within this file.
   - Ensure this file is included in relevant HTML files where user input validation is required.

2. **auth.py**
   - Use this file to manage server-side authentication processes such as login, logout, and user authentication.
   - Developers can extend the functionality by adding additional authentication methods or integrating with external authentication services.
   - Ensure this file is imported and utilized in the appropriate server-side scripts or routes.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including validating email, password, and username formats, as well as determining password strength.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates if the input email is in a valid format.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates if the input password meets the criteria of at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates if the input username is between 3-20 characters long and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** Import `InputValidator` class from this file to use the validation functions in your authentication logic.

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies.
