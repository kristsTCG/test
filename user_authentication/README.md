# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. It includes scripts for validating user input and handling authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized with two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python. These files are responsible for validating user input and managing user authentication, respectively.

## Key Files
1. `validator.js`: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input such as email addresses, passwords, and other form data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring data integrity and security within the authentication process.

2. `auth.py`: The Python script `auth.py` handles user authentication processes such as login, registration, and password management. It interacts with the database and manages user sessions to authenticate users securely.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions provided in `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code and call the necessary validation functions as needed.

2. For user authentication functionalities, import `auth.py` into your Python code and utilize the functions within the script to handle user login, registration, and password-related tasks.

3. Ensure to follow best practices for user authentication and data validation to maintain the security and integrity of user information within the application.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Assesses the strength of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class in your code:
```javascript
const InputValidator = require('./validator.js');
```
Then, you can use the validation methods provided by the `InputValidator` class.

**Dependencies:** This file does not have any external dependencies.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.

- `logout`: Method to end a user's session based on the session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Instantiate the `UserAuth` class to manage user authentication operations.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords.
- `json`: For JSON serialization (not used in this file).
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints (not used in this file).
