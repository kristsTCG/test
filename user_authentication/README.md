# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. These files handle user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder contains two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters responsible for user input validation.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters handling user authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
This file is crucial for validating user input data to ensure it meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication.

### auth.py
The `auth.py` file is essential for managing user authentication within the project. It handles user login, registration, and authentication processes.

## Usage
1. To use the validation functionality provided by `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code and call the necessary validation functions as needed.

2. For user authentication processes, utilize the functions and methods defined in `auth.py`. This file contains the necessary logic for user login, registration, and authentication.

3. Ensure to follow the guidelines and documentation within each file to understand the specific functions and methods available for user authentication and validation.
