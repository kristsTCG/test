# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality in the project. This module handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication features efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user data meets the required criteria before proceeding with authentication processes.

2. **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication logic. It includes functions for verifying user credentials and managing user sessions securely.

## Usage
To utilize the user authentication functionality provided in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation rules applied to user input data.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to familiarize yourself with the authentication logic and session management implemented in Python.
3. Integrate these files into your project to enable user authentication features securely.
