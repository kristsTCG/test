# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- `validator.js`: This file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
- `auth.py`: This Python file handles the authentication process for users. It includes functions for verifying user credentials and granting access to authorized users.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functions in `validator.js`, import the file into your JavaScript code and call the necessary validation functions as needed.
2. For user authentication processes, import `auth.py` into your Python code and utilize the provided functions to authenticate users and manage access control.

Ensure that you follow the specific guidelines and requirements set within each file for successful user authentication within the project.
