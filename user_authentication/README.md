# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**
   - Language: JavaScript
   - Size: 1212 characters
   - Role: Responsible for validating user input data to ensure it meets the required criteria for authentication.

2. **auth.py**
   - Language: Python
   - Size: 2198 characters
   - Role: Manages the authentication process for users, including login, logout, and session management.

## Usage
1. To utilize the validation functionality, refer to `validator.js`. This file contains functions to validate user input data before proceeding with authentication processes.

2. For authentication tasks such as login and session management, interact with `auth.py`. This file handles user authentication operations and ensures secure access to the system.

## validator.js

**Purpose:** This file provides input validation utilities for user authentication, including email, password, and username validation, as well as password strength assessment.

**Key Components:**
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the format of an email address.
- `validatePassword(password)`: Validates the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- `validateUsername(username)`: Validates the format of a username allowing alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- `getPasswordStrength(password)`: Calculates the strength level of a password based on length and character types.

**Usage:** To use this file, import `InputValidator` class in your code and call the validation functions as needed.

```javascript
const InputValidator = require('./validator.js');

if (InputValidator.validateEmail('example@email.com')) {
    console.log('Email is valid');
}

const password = 'SecurePwd123';
if (InputValidator.validatePassword(password)) {
    console.log('Password meets requirements');
}

const username = 'user_123';
if (InputValidator.validateUsername(username)) {
    console.log('Username is valid');
}

const passwordStrength = InputValidator.getPasswordStrength(password);
console.log('Password strength:', passwordStrength);
```

**Dependencies:** No external dependencies are required for this file.

## auth.py

**Purpose:** This file implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

**Key Components:**
- `UserAuth`: Class that manages user registration, login, and session handling.
- `hash_password`: Method to hash a password using SHA-256.
- `register_user`: Method to register a new user with a unique username, email, and password.
- `login`: Method to authenticate a user with a username and password and generate a session token.
- `logout`: Method to end a user's session using their session token.
- `is_authenticated`: Method to check if a session token is valid and active.

**Usage:** Import the `UserAuth` class from this file to handle user authentication in your Python application.

**Dependencies:**
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.
- `json`: For JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
- `timedelta`: For calculating time differences.
- `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
