# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This folder is responsible for handling user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The `user_authentication` folder consists of two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters, responsible for validating user input data.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters, responsible for implementing user authentication logic.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Role**: Responsible for validating user input data.
- **Size**: 1212 characters
- **Usage**: Ensures that user-provided data meets specified criteria before further processing.

### auth.py
- **Role**: Implements user authentication logic.
- **Size**: 2198 characters
- **Usage**: Handles user authentication processes such as login, registration, and password management.

## Usage
1. Ensure that the necessary dependencies for both JavaScript and Python are installed.
2. Use `validator.js` for validating user input data by calling relevant functions within your code.
3. Utilize `auth.py` for implementing user authentication processes by importing and using the defined functions in your project.
