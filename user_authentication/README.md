# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains code related to user authentication functionalities in the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files, `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It includes functions for user login, registration, and other authentication-related tasks.

## Usage
To utilize the code in this folder:
1. Review `validator.js` for validation functions and ensure that user input data is validated before proceeding with authentication processes.
2. Refer to `auth.py` for user authentication logic implementation. Use the functions provided in this file for user login, registration, and other authentication tasks.
3. Ensure that both files are integrated into the project's authentication workflow to maintain secure user authentication processes.
