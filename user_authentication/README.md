## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- **Role:** Responsible for validating user input data.
- **Character Count:** 1212
- **Language:** JavaScript

### auth.py
- **Role:** Handles authentication logic for user login and access control.
- **Character Count:** 2198
- **Language:** Python

## Usage
1. **validator.js**:
   - Modify the validation rules as needed for user input data.
   - Ensure the correct implementation of validation logic in the project.

2. **auth.py**:
   - Utilize the authentication functions provided to manage user login and access control.
   - Integrate the authentication logic with other parts of the project that require user authentication.
