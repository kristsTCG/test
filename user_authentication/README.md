# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionality within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
- **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria for authentication.
  
- **auth.py**: The Python file `auth.py` is responsible for handling the authentication process. It manages user login, registration, and authentication tasks within the system.

## Usage
To work with the code in this folder, follow these steps:
1. Review the `validator.js` file to understand the validation logic and criteria for user input.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to familiarize yourself with the authentication process and functions available for user management.
3. Integrate these files into your project as needed for user authentication functionalities.
