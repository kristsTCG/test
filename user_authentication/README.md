# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. This includes validation of user input and authentication logic.

## Structure
The folder is organized to handle user authentication tasks efficiently. It contains two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This file contains functions for validating user input data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that user-provided information meets the required criteria and is safe for processing.
   
2. **auth.py**: The `auth.py` file is responsible for handling user authentication processes. It includes functions for user login, registration, and authentication checks. This file is essential for securing user access to the system.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in this folder:
- Use the `validator.js` file to validate user input data before processing.
- Incorporate the `auth.py` file to manage user authentication processes such as login, registration, and authentication checks within the project.
