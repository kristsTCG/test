# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder is organized to manage user authentication tasks efficiently. It includes two key files: `validator.js` written in JavaScript and `auth.py` written in Python.

## Key Files
1. **validator.js**: This JavaScript file contains 1212 characters and is responsible for validating user inputs and ensuring data integrity during the authentication process.
   
2. **auth.py**: This Python file contains 2198 characters and manages the authentication logic, including user login, registration, and session management.

## Usage
To utilize the functionalities provided in the `user_authentication` folder:
1. Review the `validator.js` file for input validation rules and customize them as needed.
2. Explore the `auth.py` file to understand the authentication flow and integrate it with other parts of the project.
3. Ensure to handle errors and exceptions gracefully to enhance the security and user experience of the authentication process.
