# user_authentication

## Overview
The `user_authentication` folder contains files related to user authentication functionalities within the project. It handles user validation and authentication processes.

## Structure
The folder `user_authentication` contains two key files:
- `validator.js`: A JavaScript file with 1212 characters that likely handles client-side validation logic.
- `auth.py`: A Python file with 2198 characters that likely manages server-side authentication processes.

## Key Files
### validator.js
- Role: Handles client-side validation logic for user inputs.
- Size: 1212 characters

### auth.py
- Role: Manages server-side authentication processes such as login, registration, and session management.
- Size: 2198 characters

## Usage
1. Ensure that `validator.js` is included in the frontend codebase to handle client-side validation.
2. Utilize `auth.py` in the backend to implement user authentication functionalities like login, registration, and session management.
3. Customize the validation rules in `validator.js` as per project requirements.
4. Implement additional authentication logic in `auth.py` if needed, such as integrating with a database or external authentication services.
